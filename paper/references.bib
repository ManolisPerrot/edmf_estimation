  abstract = {In mathematics, the Wiener process is a real valued continuous-time stochastic process named in honor of American mathematician Norbert Wiener for his investigations on the mathematical properties of the one-dimensional Brownian motion. It is often also called Brownian motion due to its historical connection with the physical process of the same name originally observed by Scottish botanist Robert Brown. It is one of the best known L{\'e}vy processes (c{\`a}dl{\`a}g stochastic processes with stationary independent increments) and occurs frequently in pure and applied mathematics, economics, quantitative finance, evolutionary biology, and physics. The Wiener process plays an important role in both pure and applied mathematics. In pure mathematics, the Wiener process gave rise to the study of continuous time martingales. It is a key process in terms of which more complicated stochastic processes can be described. As such, it plays a vital role in stochastic calculus, diffusion processes and even potential theory. It is the driving process of Schramm--Loewner evolution. In applied mathematics, the Wiener process is used to represent the integral of a white noise Gaussian process, and so is useful as a model of noise in electronics engineering (see Brownian noise), instrument errors in filtering theory and disturbances in control theory. The Wiener process has applications throughout the mathematical sciences. In physics it is used to study Brownian motion, the diffusion of minute particles suspended in fluid, and other types of diffusion via the Fokker--Planck and Langevin equations. It also forms the basis for the rigorous path integral formulation of quantum mechanics (by the Feynman--Kac formula, a solution to the Schr{\"o}dinger equation can be represented in terms of the Wiener process) and the study of eternal inflation in physical cosmology. It is also prominent in the mathematical theory of finance, in particular the Black--Scholes option pricing model.},

They are derived from the Navier--Stokes equations by employing stochastic versions of the Boussinesq and the hydrostatic approximations. The temperature dependence of the turbulent pressure can be seen as a consequence of an additive noise acting on the small vertical dynamics. For such model we prove global well--posedness in H1 where the noise is considered in both the It{\textasciicircum}o and Stratonovich formulations. Compared to previous variants of the primitive equations, the one considered here present a more intricate coupling between the velocity field and the temperature. The corresponding analysis is seriously more involved than in the deterministic setting. Finally, the continuous dependence on the initial data and the energy estimates proven here are new, even in the case of isothermal turbulent pressure.},

  abstract = {The downward propagation of near-inertial internal waves following winter storms is examined in the context of a 2-yr record of velocity in the upper 800 m at Ocean Station Papa. The long time series allow accurate estimation of wave frequency, whereas the continuous data in depth allow separation into upward- and downward-propagating components. Near-inertial kinetic energy (KEin) dominates the record. At all measured depths, energy in downgoing motions exceeds that of upward-propagating motions by factors of 3--7, whereas KEin is elevated by a factor of 3--5 in winter relative to summer. The two successive winters are qualitatively similar but show important differences in timing and depth penetration. Energy is seen radiating downward in a finite number of wave groups, which are tagged and catalogued to determine the vertical group velocity cgz, which has a mean of about 1.5 3 1024 m s21 (13 m day21). Case studies of three of these are presented in detail. Downward energy flux is estimated as cgz 3 KEin (i) by summing over the set of events, (ii) from time series near the bottom of the record, and (iii) from the wavenumber--frequency spectrum and the dispersion relationship. These estimates are compared to the work done on near-inertial motions in the mixed layer by the wind, which is directly estimated from mixed layer near-inertial currents and winds measured from a surface buoy 10 km away. All three methods yield similar values, indicating that 12\%--33\% of the energy input into the mixed layer transits 800 m toward the deep sea. This simple picture neglects lateral energy flux carried by the first few vertical modes, which was not measured. The substantial deep penetration implies that nearinertial motions may play a role in mixing the deep ocean, but the strong observed variability calls for a need to better understand the role of lateral mesoscale structures in modulating the vertical propagation.},

NIWs are generated by a variety of mechanisms, including the wind, nonlinear interactions with waves of other frequencies, lee waves over bottom topography, and geostrophic adjustment; the partition among these is not known, although the wind is likely the most important. NIWs likely interact strongly with mesoscale and submesoscale motions, in ways that are just beginning to be understood.},

  abstract = {Abstract A theory of the interaction of a cumulus cloud ensemble with the large-scale environment is developed. In this theory, the large-scale environment is divided into the subcloud mixed layer and the region above. The time changes of the environment are governed by the heat and moisture budget equations for the subcloud mixed layer and for the region above, and by a prognostic equation for the depth of the mixed layer. In the environment above the mixed layer, the cumulus convection affects the temperature and moisture fields through cumulus-induced subsidence and detrainment of saturated air containing liquid water which evaporates in the environment. In the subcloud mixed layer, the cumulus convection does not act directly on the temperature and moisture fields, but it affects the depth of the mixed layer through cumulus-induced subsidence. Under these conditions the problem of parameterization of cumulus convection reduces to the determination of the vertical distributions of the total vertical mass flux by the ensemble, the total detrainment of mass from the ensemble, and the thermodynamical properties of the detraining air. The cumulus ensemble is spectrally divided into sub-ensembles according to the fractional entrainment rate, given by the ratio of the entrainment per unit height to the vertical mass flux in the cloud. For these sub-ensembles, the budget equations for mass, moist static energy, and total water content are obtained. The solutions of these equations give the temperature excess, the water vapor excess, and the liquid water content of each sub-ensemble, and further reduce the problem of parameterization to the determination of the mass flux distribution function, which is the sub-ensemble vertical mass flux at the top of the mixed layer. The cloud work function, which is an integral measure of the buoyancy force in the clouds, is defined for each sub-ensemble; and, under the assumption that it is in quasi-equilibrium, an integral equation for the mass flux distribution function is derived. This equation describes how a cumulus ensemble is forced by large-scale advection, radiation, and surface turbulent fluxes, and it provides a closed parameterization of cumulus convection for use in prognostic models of large-scale atmospheric motion.},

  abstract = {The present study focuses on identifying the parameters from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model that strongly influence the simulation of tropical cyclones over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) region. Three global sensitivity analysis (SA) methods, namely, the Morris One-at-A-Time (MOAT), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), and surrogate-based Sobol', are employed to identify the most sensitive parameters out of 24 tunable parameters corresponding to seven parameterization schemes of the WRF model. Ten tropical cyclones across different categories, such as cyclonic storms, severe cyclonic storms, and very severe cyclonic storms over BoB between 2011 and 2018, are selected in this study. The sensitivity scores of 24 parameters are evaluated for eight meteorological variables. The parameter sensitivity results are consistent across three SA methods for all the variables, and 8 out of the 24 parameters contribute 80 \%--90 \% to the overall sensitivity scores. It is found that the Sobol' method with Gaussian progress regression as a surrogate model can produce reliable sensitivity results when the available samples exceed 200. The parameters with which the model simulations have the least RMSE values when compared with the observations are considered the optimal parameters. Comparing observations and model simulations with the default and optimal parameters shows that simulations with the optimal set of parameters yield a 16.74 \% improvement in the 10 m wind speed, 3.13 \% in surface air temperature, 0.73 \% in surface air pressure, and 9.18 \% in precipitation simulations compared to the default set of parameters.},

The geostrophic ow is idealized as steady and barotropic with a sinusoidal dependence on the north-south coordinate; the corresponding streamfunction takes the form c 5 2 C cos (2a y). Near-inertial oscillations are considered in linear theory and disturbances are decomposed into horizontal and vertical normal modes. For this particular ow, the horizontal modes are given in terms of Mathieu functions. The initial-value problem can then be solved by projecting onto this set of normal modes. A detailed solution is presented for the case in which the mixed layer is set into motion as a slab. There is no initial horizontal structure in the model mixed layer; rather, horizontal structure, such as enhanced near-inertial energy in regions of negative vorticity, is impressed on the near-inertial elds by the pre-existing geostrophic ow.},

  abstract = {Abstract An important open question in fluid dynamics concerns the effect of small scales in structuring a fluid flow. In oceanic or atmospheric flows, this is aptly captured in wave--current interactions through the study of the well-known Langmuir secondary circulation. Such wave--current interactions are described by the Craik--Leibovich system, in which the action of a wave-induced velocity, the Stokes drift, produces a so-called ``vortex force'' that causes streaking in the flow. In this work, we show that these results can be generalized as a generic effect of the spatial inhomogeneity of the statistical properties of the small-scale flow components. As demonstrated, this is well captured through a stochastic representation of the flow.},

  abstract = {A stochastic representation based on a physical transport principle is proposed to account for mesoscale eddy effects on the evolution of the large-scale flow. This framework arises from a decomposition of the Lagrangian velocity into a smooth (in time) component and a highly oscillating term. One important characteristic of this random model is that it conserves the energy of any transported scalar. Such an energy-preserving representation is tested for the coarse simulation of a barotropic circulation in a shallow ocean basin, driven by a symmetric double-gyres wind forcing. The empirical spatial correlation of the random small-scale velocity is estimated from data of an eddy-resolving simulation. After reaching a turbulent equilibrium state, a statistical analysis of tracers shows that the proposed random model enables us to reproduce accurately, on a coarse mesh, the local structures of the first four statistical moments (mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis) of the high-resolution eddy-resolved data.},

To better interpret the origin of that uncertainty, we analyze the sensitivity of the tropical cloud radiative forcing to a change in sea surface temperature that is simulated by 15 coupled models simulating climate change and current interannual variability. We show that it is in regimes of large-scale subsidence that the model results (1) differ the most in climate change and (2) disagree the most with observations in the current climate (most models underestimate the interannual sensitivity of clouds albedo to a change in temperature). This suggests that the simulation of the sensitivity of marine boundary layer clouds to changing environmental conditions constitutes, currently, the main source of uncertainty in tropical cloud feedbacks simulated by general circulation models.},

We focus here on the representation of the physical climate along with the main characteristics of the global carbon cycle. The model's climatology, as assessed from a range of metrics (related in particular to radiation, temperature, precipitation, and wind), is strongly improved in comparison to previous model versions. Although they are reduced, a number of known biases and shortcomings (e.g., double Intertropical Convergence Zone [ITCZ], frequency of midlatitude wintertime blockings, and El Ni{\~n}o--Southern Oscillation [ENSO] dynamics) persist. The equilibrium climate sensitivity and transient climate response have both increased from the previous climate model IPSL-CM5A-LR used in CMIP5. A large ensemble of more than 30 members for the historical period (1850--2018) and a smaller ensemble for a range of emissions scenarios (until 2100 and 2300) are also presented and discussed.},

We propose a new perspective based on a large deviation estimate for the probability of the empirical distribution dynamics. Assuming Boltzmann molecular chaos hypothesis (Stosszahlansatz), we derive a large deviation rate function, or action, that describes the stochastic process for the empirical distribution. The quasipotential for this action is the negative of the entropy when the conservation laws are verified, as should be expected. While the Boltzmann equation appears as the most probable evolution, corresponding to a law of large numbers, the action describes a genuine reversible stochastic process for the empirical distribution, in agreement with the microscopic reversibility. As a consequence, this large deviation perspective gives the expected meaning to the Boltzmann equation and explains its irreversibility as the natural consequence of limiting the physical description to the most probable evolution. More interestingly, it also quantifies the probability of any dynamical evolution departing from solutions of the Boltzmann equation. This picture is fully compatible with the heuristic classical view of irreversibility, but makes it much more precise in various ways. We also explain that this large deviation action provides a natural gradient structure for the Boltzmann equation.},

The method is illustrated with three applications, showing that uncertainties can produce a major effect in the circulation model, in the ecosystem model, and in the sea ice model.

The results of experiments performed with a low resolution global ocean model show that this parameterization has a considerable effect on the average large-scale circulation of the ocean, especially in the regions of intense mesoscale activity. The large-scale flow is less geostrophic, with more intense associated vertical velocities, and the average geographical position of the main temperature and salinity fronts is more consistent with observations. In particular, the simulations suggest that the stochastic effect of the unresolved temperature and salinity fluctuations on the large-scale density field may be sufficient to explain why the Gulf Stream pathway systematically overshoots in non-stochastic low resolution ocean models.},

  abstract = {Abstract A new parameterization of shallow cumulus convection is presented. The parameterization consists of a mass flux scheme based on a buoyancy-sorting, entrainment--detrainment plume model. The mass flux scheme is coupled to a 1.5-order turbulence closure model with an entrainment closure for convective boundary layers. Model performance is verified using single-column-model simulations at relatively high vertical resolution of pure trade-cumulus convection and a cumulus to stratocumulus transition. Mixing rates, cloud cover, and vertical flux profiles, as deduced from previously published large-eddy simulation studies, are well reproduced by the parameterization. The model is used to demonstrate that height variations of lateral mixing rates can be successfully captured by a simple implementation of a buoyancy-sorting mechanism in the updraft cloud model. A companion paper describes the implementation of the scheme in a mesoscale model.},

  abstract = {A new moist turbulence parameterization is presented and implemented in the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM). It is derived from Grenier and Bretherton but has been heavily modified to improve its numerical stability and efficiency with the long time steps used in climate models. A goal was to provide a more physically realistic treatment of marine stratocumulus-topped boundary layers than in the current CAM. Key features of the scheme include use of moist-conserved variables, an explicit entrainment closure for convective layers, diagnosis of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) for computation of turbulent diffusivities, an efficient new formulation of TKE transport as a relaxation to layer-mean TKE, and unified treatment of all turbulent layers in each atmospheric column. The scheme is compared with the default turbulence parameterizations in the CAM using three single-column modeling cases, using both operational and high vertical and time resolution. Both schemes performed comparably well on the dry convective boundary layer case. For a stable boundary layer case, the default CAM overdeepens the boundary layer unless its free-tropospheric mixing length is greatly reduced, whereupon the new scheme and default CAM again both perform well at both tested resolutions. A nocturnal stratocumulus case was much better simulated by the new scheme than the default CAM, with much less resolution sensitivity. Global climate simulations with the new scheme in tandem with a new shallow cumulus parameterization are presented in a companion paper.},

  abstract = {Abstract Cold air blowing out over a warm ocean leads to convection over an isolated region of the ocean basin. This phenomenon, known as open-ocean convection, is often simulated by convective forcing from a circular disk much smaller than the dimension of the domain. An important feature of these simulations is the development of eddies at the edge of the disk that serve to transport heat horizontally. This has sparked interest in the heat-flux characteristics of such a system. This paper deals with the thermodynamic properties of this type of convective flow, using a rotating tank with bottom-mounted hotplate as the experimental apparatus. Experiments are performed, in an initially unstratified fluid, for a set of values of the nondimensional forcing parameter Rc = B1/2/(Hf3/2), where B is the buoyancy flux, H is the fluid depth, and f is the Coriolis parameter. The ratio of the frontal eddy size to the hotplate radius, {$\varepsilon$}, is shown to be an important parameter. The experiments reported are for the regime {$\varepsilon$} {$\sim$} O(1), consistent with those of other researchers. The author shows that {$\varepsilon$} {$\ll$} 1 is the more relevant case oceanographically, a fact that is likely more important thermodynamically than dynamically. The evolution of the mean temperature (difference) above the heating region is determined, from which can he deduced the vertical/horizontal heat flux partitioning as a function of time and Rc. The average behavior of the mean temperature field ({\=T}) above the plate follows a relation: {\=T}(t) = Te tanh(t/{$\tau$}), where t is time and Te and {$\tau$} are functions of Rc. The nondimensional adjustment timescale is found to be {$\tau$}f = 4.27 Rc-2/3, which implies that the dimensional timescale {$\tau$} is, remarkably, independent of the rotation rate. The equilibrium temperature scale Te, expressed as a buoyancy deficit and nondimensionalized, is well described by g{$\alpha$}Te/H1/3 = (4.67) Rc-0.075 and is thus also effectively independent of f. A heton-type model for the mean temperature field is developed with {\=T}(t) as solution to its associated differential equation. The physical model, the differential equation, plus the (determined) properties of its solution constitute a parameterized thermodynamic model of this form of convection with potential use in meso-scale ocean climate models. Ideas are presented on how this could be done.},

Applying this method in a simulation of the diurnal cycle of a marine stratocumulus-topped boundary layer shows that coherent updraft and downdraft structures contribute to most of the total transport of heat and moisture, although covering a small part of the domain volume. On average, downdrafts contribute equally compared to updrafts for moisture fluxes and more than updrafts for heat fluxes. The relative contribution of updraft and downdraft objects to heat transport exhibits a large diurnal cycle, which suggests cloud-turbulence-radiation interaction.

Conditions of low surface wind and strong solar heating result in diurnal warming of the oceanic surface of 2 {$^\circ$}C over a depth of 1 m. Analysis of specific periods covering the diurnal cycle shows the contrasting effects of cloud shading, rain, and turbulent heat fluxes under the cold pools on the sea temperature at the surface and below. On the one hand, decreasing the solar radiation (cloud shading) results in slight cooling extended horizontally and penetrating down to 1--2 m depth, depending on the time of the day.

While the focus has so far been on the balanced dynamics of these instabilities, they occur in and depend on an environment shaped by atmospherically forced small-scale turbulence. In this study, idealized numerical simulations are presented that allow the development of both baroclinic instability and convective small-scale turbulence, with simple control over the relative strength. If the convection is only weakly forced, baroclinic instability restratifies the layer and shuts off convection, as expected. With increased forcing, however, it is found that baroclinic instabilities are remarkably resilient to the presence of convection. Even if the instability is too weak to restratify the layer and shut off convection, the instability still grows in the convecting environment and generates baroclinic eddies and fronts. This suggests that despite the vigorous atmospherically forced small-scale turbulence in winter mixed layers, baroclinic instabilities can persistently grow, generate balanced submesoscale turbulence, and modify the bulk properties of the upper ocean.},

  abstract = {Turbulent fluxes can be represented by a diffusivity tensor, the symmetric part of which describes ``turbulent diffusion'' while the anti-symmetric part describes ``advection''. Diffusion is a local process in the sense that it depends only on the local gradients of the mean fields while advection is non-local for it is represented by an integral over all length scales (all eddies) that can ``fit'' from say the bottom of the physical domain to the z where the fluxes are computed. In the ocean, there are two main regimes where non-local transport is important. One regime is where storms release a sudden burst of mechanical energy to the ocean surface that is then transported downward by energetic eddies that deepen the mixed layer. Even relatively simple non-local models yield results considerably more realistic than those of local models. The second regime is deep convection (DC) caused by loss of surface buoyancy, the description of which is required for a reliable assessment of water masses formation. At present, there is no reliable model for either of these non-local regimes individually or much less a formalism capable of accounting for both regimes simultaneously. The goal of this paper is to present a formalism that provides the expressions for the non-local fluxes for momentum, heat and salinity encompassing both cases. Since the resulting number of dynamic equations involves is however large, we work out two sub-models, one when only shear must be treated non-locally (e.g., when storms release mechanical energy) and one when only buoyancy is to be treated non-locally (the DC case). We employ the Reynolds Stress formalism in which non-locality is represented by the third-order moments which in turn depend on the fourth-order moments for which we employ a new model that has been tested against LES data, aircraft data and a full PBL simulation. For the DC case, we rewrite the non-local model in terms of Plumes since thus far the only non-local model used to treat oceanic DC has been the ``plume model'' of Morton, Taylor and Turner (MTT model). We show that the MTT model has two key limitations, (1) an important physical process such as the rate of entrainment cannot be determined by the model and remains an adjustable parameter and (2) MTT is purely advective and thus only applicable to the initial stages of DC but not to the whole process which is both advective and diffusive.

  abstract = {In this paper, we consider the 3D primitive equations of oceanic and atmospheric dynamics with only horizontal eddy viscosities in the horizontal momentum equations and only vertical diffusivity in the temperature equation. Global well-posedness of strong solutions is established for any initial data such that the initial horizontal velocity v0{$\in$}H2({\textohm}) and the initial temperature T0{$\in$}H1({\textohm}){$\cap$}L{$\infty$}({\textohm}) with ∇HT0{$\in$}Lq({\textohm}), for some q{$\in$}(2,{$\infty$}). Moreover, the strong solutions enjoy correspondingly more regularities if the initial temperature belongs to H2({\textohm}). The main difficulties are the absence of the vertical viscosity and the lack of the horizontal diffusivity, which, interact with each other, thus causing the ``mismatching'' of regularities between the horizontal momentum and temperature equations. To handle this ``mismatching'' of regularities, we introduce several auxiliary functions, i.e., {$\eta$},{\texttheta},{$\varphi$}, and {$\psi$} in the paper, which are the horizontal curls or some appropriate combinations of the temperature with the horizontal divergences of the horizontal velocity v or its vertical derivative {$\partial$}zv. To overcome the difficulties caused by the absence of the horizontal diffusivity, which leads to the requirement of some Lt1(Wx1,{$\infty$})-type a priori estimates on v, we decompose the velocity into the ``temperature-independent'' and temperature-dependent parts and deal with them in different ways, by using the logarithmic Sobolev inequalities of the Br{\'e}zis--Gallouet--Wainger and Beale--Kato--Majda types, respectively. Specifically, a logarithmic Sobolev inequality of the limiting type, introduced in our previous work (Cao et~al., 2016), is used, and a new logarithmic type Gronwall inequality is exploited.},

Velocity and temperature measurements were made with a single {\texttimes}{\texttimes}{\textbackslash}times-wire probe thermo-anemometry technique, using multi-overheat sequences to deliver simultaneous velocity--temperature data at high frequency. The spatial resolution was found to be fine enough, in relation to the dissipative scale and the thermal diffusive scale, to avoid false mixing enhancement in the analysis of the physical mechanisms through velocity--temperature coupling in statistical turbulence quantities. Probability density functions (PDFs) and joint probability density functions (JPDFs) were used to distinguish between the different mechanisms involved in turbulent mixing, namely entrainment, engulfing, nibbling and mixing, and point to the contribution of entrainment in the mixing process. When comparing an unstably stratified configuration to its stably stratified equivalent, no significant difference could be seen in the PDF and JPDF quantities, but a conditional analysis based on temperature thresholding enabled a separation between mixed fluid and two distinct sets of events associated with unmixed fluid entrained from the hot and cold sides of the mixing layer into the mixing layer. This separation allowed a direct calculation of the entrainment velocities on both sides of the mixing layer. A significant increase of the total entrainment could be seen in the case of unstably stratified configuration. The entrainment ratios were compared to their prediction by the Dimotakis model and both a rather good relevance of the model and some need for improvement were found from the comparison. It was hypothesised that the improvement should come from better taking into account the distinct contributions of nibbling and engulfing inside the process of entrainment and mixing.},

It is shown that the effect of the Coriolis force is to inhibit the onset of convection, the extent of the inhibition depending on the value of the non-dimensional parameter T = 4d4{\textohm}2 cos2 {\textvartheta}/v2, where d denotes the depth of the layer and v is the kinematic viscosity. Tables of the critical Rayleigh numbers (Rc) for the onset of convection are provided for the three cases (a) both bounding surfaces free, (b) both bounding surfaces rigid and (c) one bounding surface free and the other rigid. In all three cases Rc{$\rightarrow$}constant x T2/3 as T{$\rightarrow\infty$} ; the corresponding dependence of the critical temperature gradient (---{$\beta$}c) for the onset of convection, on v and d, is g{$\alpha\beta$}c = constant x K({\textohm}4 cos4 {\textvartheta}/d4v)1/2 (K is the coefficient of thermometric conductivity and {$\alpha$} is the coefficient of volume expansion). The question whether thermal instability can set in as oscillations of increasing amplitude (i.e. as 'overstability') is examined for case (a), and it is shown that if K/v{$<$}1.478, this possibility does not arise; but if K/v{$>$}1.478, over-stability is the first type of instability to arise for all T greater than a certain determinate value. It further appears that these latter possibilities should be considered in meteorological and astrophysical applications of the theory.},

No simple set of causal relationships can be found which relate the state of the atmosphere at one instant of time to its state at another. It was this realization that led V. Bjerknes in 1904 [1] to define the problem of prognosis as nothing less than the integration of the equations of motion of the atmosphere. But it remained for Richardson [12] to suggest in 1922 the practical means for the solution of this problem. He proposed to integrate the equations of motion numerically and showed exactly how this might be done. That the actual forecast used to test his method was unsuccessful was in no sense a measure of the value of his work. In retrospect, it becomes obvious that the inadequacies of observation alone would have doomed any attempt however well conceived, a circumstance of which Rich\-ardson was aware. The real value of his work lay in the fact that it crystallized once and for all the essential problems that would have to be faced by future workers in the field and that it laid down a thorough ground\-work for their solution.},

  abstract = {Abstract Continuous development and evaluation of planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterizations in hurricane conditions are crucial for improving tropical cyclone (TC) forecasts. A turbulence kinetic energy (TKE)-based eddy-diffusivity mass-flux (EDMF-TKE) PBL scheme, implemented in NOAA's Hurricane Analysis and Forecast System (HAFS), was recently improved in hurricane conditions using large-eddy simulations. This study evaluates the performance of HAFS TC forecasts with the original (experiment HAFA) and modified EDMF-TKE (experiment HAFY) based on a large sample of cases during the 2021 North Atlantic hurricane season. Results indicate that intensity and structure forecast skill was better overall in HAFY than in HAFA, including during rapid intensification. Composite analyses demonstrate that HAFY produces shallower and stronger boundary layer inflow, especially within 1--3 times the radius of maximum wind (RMW). Stronger inflow and more moisture in the boundary layer contribute to stronger moisture convergence near the RMW. These boundary layer characteristics are consistent with stronger, deeper, and more compact TC vortices in HAFY than in HAFA. Nevertheless, track skill in HAFY is slightly reduced, which is in part attributable to the cross-track error from a few early cycles of Hurricane Henri that exhibited {$\sim$}400 n mi (1 n mi = 1.852 km) track error at longer lead times. Sensitivity experiments based on HAFY demonstrate that turning off cumulus schemes notably reduces the track errors of Henri while turning off the deep cumulus scheme reduces the intensity errors. This finding hints at the necessity of unifying the mass fluxes in PBL and cumulus schemes in future model physics development.},

Unfortunately, non gaussianity is weak (i.e. no intermittency) and vorticity gets preferentially aligned with the wrong eigenvector of the deformation. We then show that slightly modifying the former vectorial field in order to impose the long range correlated nature of turbulence allows to reproduce the main properties of stationary flows. Doing so, we end up with a realistic incompressible, skewed and intermittent velocity field that reproduces the main characteristics of 3D turbulence in the inertial range, including correct vorticity alignment properties.},

Many versions of KPP exist in the oceanic sciences community, and one of their main differences is how they take the effects of nonbreaking waves into account. Although there is qualitative consensus that nonbreaking waves enhance vertical mixing due to the ensuing Langmuir circulations, there is no consensus on the quantitative aspects and modeling approach. In this paper we use a recently developed method to estimate both components of KPP (the diffusive term, usually called local, and the nondiffusive component, usually called nonlocal) based on numerically simulated turbulent fluxes without any a priori assumptions about their scaling or their shape. Through this method we show that the cubic shape usually used in KPP is not optimal for wavy situations and propose new ones. Furthermore, we show that the formulation for the nondiffusive fluxes, which currently only depend on the presence of surface buoyancy fluxes, should also take wave effects into account. We also investigate how the application of these changes to KPP improves the representation of turbulent fluxes in a diagnostic approach when compared with previous models.},

The reliability of a simulation is mainly dependent on the turbulence model adopted, and improving its accuracy is a crucial issue. In this study, we investigated the potential for an alternative formulation of the Navier--Stokes equations, based on the stochastic representation of the velocity field. The new approach, named pseudo-stochastic simulation (PSS), is a generalisation of the widespread classical eddy--viscosity model, where the contribution of the unresolved scales of motion is expressed by a variance tensor, modelled following different paradigms. The PSS models were compared with the classical ones mathematically and numerically in the turbulent channel flow at     R  e {$\tau$}  = 590    . The PSS and the classical models are equivalent when the variance tensor is shaped through a molecular dissipation analogy, while it is more accurate when the tensor is defined by the way of a local variance model. A near-wall damping function derived from recent advancement in the field is also proposed and was successfully validated. The analyses demonstrate the relevance of the approach proposed and provide a basis for the development of an alternative turbulence model.},

Following the initiation of the heating, a cylinder of well-mixed fluid forms above the heated plate and as it grows upward it steadily erodes the overlying ambient stratification. Measurements of the root-mean-square velocities in the mixed layer indicate that rotation affects but does not control the turbulence, and the nonrotating turbulent velocity and length scales are thus appropriate to describe the small-scale turbulence. Rotation initially confines the heated fluid to the region above the central plate, but as time progresses, the near-vertical front separating the well-mixed heated fluid and the surrounding ambient stratified fluid becomes unstable, eventually generating a field of baroclinic eddies. The breakdown is initiated by the development of a rim current centered on the periphery of the heated plate. Our experiments have confirmed that the current velocity scales as (Bt)1/2 and that it is also linearly dependent on the height within the mixed layer. The rim current eventually goes unstable, generating the eddies whose length scales measured in our experiments are in good agreement with the predictions of linear stability theory.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate that an extended eddy-diffusivity mass-flux (EDMF) scheme can be used as a unified parameterization of subgrid-scale turbulence and convection across a range of dynamical regimes, from dry convective boundary layers, through shallow convection, to deep convection. Central to achieving this unified representation of subgrid-scale motions are entrainment and detrainment closures. We model entrainment and detrainment rates as a combination of turbulent and dynamical processes. Turbulent entrainment/detrainment is represented as downgradient diffusion between plumes and their environment. Dynamical entrainment/detrainment is proportional to a ratio of a relative buoyancy of a plume and a vertical velocity scale, that is modulated by heuristic nondimensional functions which represent their relative magnitudes and the enhanced detrainment due to evaporation from clouds in drier environment. We first evaluate the closures offline against entrainment and detrainment rates diagnosed from large-eddy simulations (LES) in which tracers are used to identify plumes, their turbulent environment, and mass and tracer exchanges between them. The LES are of canonical test cases of a dry convective boundary layer, shallow convection, and deep convection, thus spanning a broad range of regimes. We then compare the LES with the full EDMF scheme, including the new closures, in a single column model (SCM). The results show good agreement between the SCM and LES in quantities that are key for climate models, including thermodynamic profiles, cloud liquid water profiles, and profiles of higher moments of turbulent statistics. The SCM also captures well the diurnal cycle of convection and the onset of precipitation. Plain Language Summary The dynamics of clouds and turbulence are too small in scale to be resolved in global models of the atmosphere, yet they play a crucial role in controlling weather and climate. These models rely on parameterizations for representing clouds and turbulence. Inadequacies in these parameterizations have hampered especially climate models for decades; they are the largest source of physical uncertainties in climate predictions. It has proven challenging to represent the wide range of cloud and turbulence regimes encountered in nature in a single parameterization. Here we present such a parameterization that does capture a wide range of cloud and turbulence regimes within a single, unified physical framework, with relatively few parameters that can be adjusted to fit data. The framework relies on a decomposition of turbulent flows into coherent updraft and downdraft (i.e., plumes) and random turbulence in their environment. A key contribution of this paper is to show how the exchange of mass and properties between the plumes and their turbulent environment---the so-called entrainment and detrainment of air into and out of plumes---can be modeled. We show that the resulting parameterization represents well the most important features of dry convective boundary layers, shallow cumulus convection, and deep cumulonimbus convection.},

However, the temperature-salinity compensation and the lack of vertical resolution contribute to over-estimated MLD, especially in regions of deep convection. In the present work, we examined the diagnostic MLD, associated with the deep convection of the Labrador Sea Water (LSW), calculated with a simple density difference criterion. The over-estimated MLD led us to develop a new tool, based on an observational approach, to recalculate MLD from model output. We used an eddy-permitting, 1/12{$^\circ$} regional configuration of the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) to test and discuss our newly defined MLD. We compared our new MLD with that from observations, and we showed a major improvement with our new algorithm. To show the new MLD is not dependent on a single model and its horizontal resolution, we extended our analysis to include 1/4{$^\circ$} eddy-permitting simulations, and simulations using the Modular Ocean Model (MOM) model.},

Aircraft in-situ measurements from the IHOP\_2002 field campaign indicate a prevalence of negative skewness of the water vapour distribution within the growing daytime CBL over land. This negative skewness is interpreted according to large-eddy simulations (LES) as the result of descending dry downdrafts originating from above the mixed layer. LES are used to determine the statistical properties of these intrusions: their size and thermodynamical characteristics. A conditional sampling analysis demonstrates their significance in the retrieval of moisture variances and fluxes. The rapid CBL growth explains why greater negative skewness is observed during the growing phase: the large amounts of dry air that are quickly incorporated into the CBL prevent a full homogenisation by turbulent mixing. The boundary-layer warming in this phase also plays a role in the acquisition of negative buoyancy for these dry tongues, and thus possibly explains their kinematics in the lower CBL. Budget analysis helps to identify the processes responsible for the negative skewness. This budget study underlines the main role of turbulent transport, which distributes the skewness produced at the top or the bottom of the CBL into the interior of the CBL. The dry tongues contribute significantly to this turbulent transport.},

  abstract = {The development of parameterizations is a major task in the development of weather and climate models. Model improvement has been slow in the past decades, due to the difficulty of encompassing key physical processes into parameterizations, but also of calibrating or ``tuning'' the many free parameters involved in their formulation. Machine learning techniques have been recently used for speeding up the development process. While some studies propose to replace parameterizations by data-driven neural networks, we rather advocate that keeping physical parameterizations is key for the reliability of climate projections. In this paper we propose to harness machine learning to improve physical parameterizations. In particular, we use Gaussian process-based methods from uncertainty quantification to calibrate the model free parameters at a process level. To achieve this, we focus on the comparison of single-column simulations and reference large-eddy simulations over multiple boundary-layer cases. Our method returns all values of the free parameters consistent with the references and any structural uncertainties, allowing a reduced domain of acceptable values to be considered when tuning the three-dimensional (3D) global model. This tool allows to disentangle deficiencies due to poor parameter calibration from intrinsic limits rooted in the parameterization formulations. This paper describes the tool and the philosophy of tuning in single-column mode. Part 2 shows how the results from our process-based tuning can help in the 3D global model tuning.},

  abstract = {Abstract Until recently, measurements below the ocean surface have tended to confirm ``law of the wall'' behavior, in which the velocity profile is logarithmic, and energy dissipation decays inversely with depth. Recent measurements, however, show a sublayer, within meters of the surface, in which turbulence is enhanced by the action of surface waves. In this layer, dissipation appears to decay with inverse depth raised to a power estimated between 3 and 4.6. The present study shows that a conventional model, employing a ``level 2{$\frac{1}{2}$}'' turbulence closure scheme predicts near-surface dissipation decaying as inverse depth to the power 3.4. The model shows agreement in detail with measured profiles of dissipation. This is despite the fact that empirical constants in the model are determined for situations very different from this near-surface application. The action of breaking waves is modeled by a turbulent kinetic energy input at the surface. In the wave-enhanced layer, the downward flux of turbulent kinetic energy balances its dissipation. The model produces analytic descriptions for the depth of the layer, and for profiles of velocity, turbulent kinetic energy, and dissipation. The surface roughness length (in the water) is a critical parameter in the solutions. There are indications of a relationship between the roughness length and surface wave parameter such as the amplitude or inverse wavenumber. Roughness lengths at least up to 1 m appear to be feasible.},

Since the model is intended to perform both large-eddy and mesoscale simulations, we have developed a full three-dimensional scheme, based on the original method of Redelsperger and Sommeria. A prognostic equation for the turbulent kinetic energy is used, together with conservative variables for moist non-precipitating processes. A particularity of the scheme is the use of variable turbulent Prandtl and Schmidt numbers, consistently derived from the complete set of second-order turbulent-moment equations. The results of three idealized boundary-layer simulations allowing detailed comparisons with other large-eddy simulation (LES) models are discussed, and lead to the conclusion that the model is performing satisfactorily. The vertical flux and gradient computation can be run in isolation from the rest of the scheme, providing an efficient single-column parametrization for the mesoscale configuration of the model, if an appropriate parametrization of the eddy length-scale is used. The mixing-length specification is then the only aspect of the scheme which differs from the LES to the mesoscale configuration, and the numerical constants used for the closure terms are the same in both configurations. The scheme is run in single-column mode for the same three cases as above, and a comparison of single-column and LES results again leads to satisfactory results. It is believed that this result is original, and is due to the proper formulation of the parametrized mixing length and of the turbulent Prandtl and Schmidt numbers. In fact, a comparison of the parametrized mixing length with the length-scale of the energy-containing eddies deduced by spectral analysis of the LES shows interesting similarity.},

Here, we report observations of semi-diurnal internal tides generated by the rough topography of the Central Indian Ridge, in the presence of a strong, lower-frequency near-inertial wave field generated by a tropical storm. The semi-diurnal internal tide energy is trapped within upward propagating bands with a periodicity close to the inertial period. A ray-tracing model suggests that this trapping results from the internal tide refraction by the shear associated with near-inertial waves. This yields a strong increase of the internal tide energy and shear in space-time regions where the background flow focuses the rays, leading to the formation of caustics. This mechanism may increase vertical mixing generated by baroclinic tides in the vicinity of mid-ocean ridges in tropical regions.},

These experiments use inter-annually varying atmospheric forcing data sets for the 60-year period from 1948 to 2007 and are performed as contributions to the second phase of the Coordinated Ocean-ice Reference Experiments (CORE-II). The protocol for conducting such CORE-II experiments is summarized. Despite using the same atmospheric forcing, the solutions show significant differences. As most models also differ from available observations, biases in the Labrador Sea region in upper-ocean potential temperature and salinity distributions, mixed layer depths, and sea-ice cover are identified as contributors to differences in AMOC. These differences in the solutions do not suggest an obvious grouping of the models based on their ocean model lineage, their vertical coordinate representations, or surface salinity restoring strengths. Thus, the solution differences among the models are attributed primarily to use of different subgrid scale parameterizations and parameter choices as well as to differences in vertical and horizontal grid resolutions in the ocean models. Use of a wide variety of sea-ice models with diverse snow and sea-ice albedo treatments also contributes to these differences. Based on the diagnostics considered, the majority of the models appear suitable for use in studies involving the North Atlantic, but some models require dedicated development effort.},

It is argued that, if the Osborn-Cox model is to describe fluxes in the general circulation, it must describe the variance budget of all fluctuations around the long-term average used to define the general circulation. Within this framework, the simplifications leading to the Osborn-Cox model are re-examined to find if they still hold and which is most likely to cause {$<$}em{$>$}K\textsubscript{v}{$<$}/em{$>$} errors. Factors examined (and the importance found) are approximations in the Fourier and Ficks diffusion laws (unimportant), accumulation and advection of tracer variance (unimportant except in regions of strong upwelling), variance production by lateral fluxes (dominant at higher latitudes), sampling errors in estimating the mean tracer gradient (unimportant), and turbulent fluxes of variance {\textlangle}{$<$}strong{$>$}u{$<$}/strong{$>\prime\theta\prime$}\textsuperscript{2}{\textrangle}. Variance production by lateral fluxes is most common where stratification is weak and causes the Osborn--Cox model to overestimate {$<$}em{$>$}K\textsubscript{v}{$<$}/em{$>$}. The triple product, or turbulent flux of variance, represents potential exchanges of variance between the small turbulent scales and larger variability scales. It cannot be dismissed by scale analysis, and relying on the analogy or a hypothesis of scale isolation to neglect this effect makes the Osborn-Cox model a theory to be verified rather than a deduction.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {The role of eddies on the formation and spreading of water masses in the Western Mediterranean Sea is studied with an ocean general circulation model. The model is forced with interannually variable surface forcing for the years from 1979 to 1999. It is found that the model reproduces the major features of the observed mesoscale variability in the Gulf of Lions and the large eddies evolution in the Algerian Basin. The seasonal evolution of circulation in the Gulf of Lions and processes of spreading of newly formed intermediate deep waters in the postconvection period is studied for years 1987 and 1992. The model results are compared with data from observations. It is shown that the instability of the transition zone between old and newly formed deep waters, which takes place after the violent mixing stages of the deep convection, leads to collapse of the mixed patch and formation of mesoscale eddies. Some of these eddies propagate out of the Gulf of Lions transporting deep waters into the Algerian Basin. The rest of the mesoscale eddies filled with newly formed deep waters remain in the Gulf of Lions and tend to merge and enlarge. After the cyclonic eddies reach the Algerian Basin they interact with the intense mesoscale field existing there. The energy analysis shows that the winter and spring are seasons of intensified baroclinic instability of the mean flow in the two regions of interest, the Gulf of Lions and Algerian Basin. The kinetic energy is released by baroclinic instability in spring and summer. The spring spectra in the two regions have maximums at horizontal scales of about 80--100 km which is the typical scale of the eddies in the model. These eddies propagate a cyclonic circuit. The resulting eddy-induced mass transport in deep and intermediate layers is directed out of the Gulf of Lions and toward the Gibraltar Strait. Equivalently, we can argue the intermediate and deep waters conveyor belt of the Western Mediterranean Sea is eddy-driven.},

  abstract = {A nonhydrostatic, Boussinesq, three-dimensional model, the ocean large-eddy simulation model (OLEM), has been developed to study deep oceanic convection. The model uses a subgrid-scale parameterization of turbulence developed for large-eddy simulation models, and the advection of scalars is accomplished using a monotonic scheme. A set of experiments was performed using OLEM to provide a direct comparison with laboratory results and aircraft measurements of the atmospheric convective boundary layer. The results from these experiments are in excellent agreement with laboratory and atmospheric convective boundary layer measurements of the mean profiles of zonal and vertical velocity variance, potential temperature variance, and heat flux. The horizontal wavenumber spectra of zonal and vertical velocity are also in good agreement with laboratory measurements and Kolmogorov's theoretical inertial subrange spectrum. A set of experiments using a potential temperature-salinity profile from the central Greenland Sea for model initialization was conducted to study the effect of the thermobaric instability and rotation on the structure and evolution of deep oceanic convection. The artificial removal of the thermobaric instability suppresses penetrative convection, which is responsible for rapid changes in water properties at depths much greater than occurs for convective, mixed-layer deepening. The vertical velocity and diameter, -0.08 m s-1 and 300 m, respectively, of the penetrative plumes are in good agreement with observations from the Greenland Sea. A period of strong penetrative convection is followed by a gradual transition to convective, mixed-layer deepening. During penetrative convection, the values of heat flux are about 2 times greater than convective, mixed-layer deepening. In the absence of rotation, the evolution of penetrative convection occurs more rapidly, and vertical motions are more vigorous. The presence of the horizontal component of rotation forces asymmetries in the circulation around a penetrative plume. These experiments clearly demonstrate the importance of thermobaric instability and rotation on deep convection. To properly model large-scale flows in regions of penetrative convection, it is necessary to include these effects in the vertical mixing parameterization.},

  abstract = {Entrainment and detrainment processes have been recognised for a long time as key processes for cumulus convection and have recently witnessed a regrowth of interest mainly due to the capability of large-eddy simulations (LES) to diagnose these processes in more detail. This article has a twofold purpose. Firstly, it provides a historical overview of the past research on these mixing processes, and secondly, it highlights more recent important developments. These include both fundamental process studies using LES aiming to improve our understanding of the mixing process, but also more practical studies targeted toward an improved parametrised representation of entrainment and detrainment in large-scale models. A highlight of the fundamental studies resolves a long-lasting controversy by showing that lateral entrainment is the dominant mixing mechanism in comparison with the cloud-top entrainment in shallow cumulus convection. The more practical studies provide a wide variety of new parametrisations with sometimes conflicting approaches to the way in which the effect of the free tropospheric humidity on the lateral mixing is taken into account. An important new insight that will be highlighted is that, despite the focus in the literature on entrainment, it appears that it is rather the detrainment process that determines the vertical structure of the convection in general and the mass flux especially. Finally, in order to speed up progress and stimulate convergence in future parametrisations, stronger and more systematic use of LES is advocated.

  abstract = {Sensitivity analysis (SA) has been widely used to screen out a small number of sensitive parameters for model outputs from all adjustable parameters in weather and climate models, helping to improve model predictions by tuning the parameters. However, most parametric SA studies have focused on a single SA method and a single model output evaluation function, which makes the screened sensitive parameters less comprehensive. In addition, qualitative SA methods are often used because simulations using complex weather and climate models are time-consuming. Unlike previous SA studies, this research has systematically evaluated the sensitivity of parameters that affect precipitation and temperature simulations in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model using both qualitative and quantitative global SA methods. In the SA studies, multiple model output evaluation functions were used to conduct various SA experiments for precipitation and temperature. The results showed that five parameters (P3, P5, P7, P10, and P16) had the greatest effect on precipitation simulation results and that two parameters (P7 and P10) had the greatest effect for temperature. Using quantitative SA, the two-way interactive effect between P7 and P10 was also found to be important, especially for precipitation. The microphysics scheme had more sensitive parameters for precipitation, and P10 (the multiplier for saturated soil water content) was the most sensitive parameter for both precipitation and temperature. From the ensemble simulations, preliminary results indicated that the precipitation and temperature simulation accuracies could be improved by tuning the respective sensitive parameter values, especially for simulations of moderate and heavy rain.},

  abstract = {We formulate a class of stochastic partial differential equations based on Kelvin's circulation theorem for ideal fluids. In these models, the velocity field is randomly transported by white-noise vector fields, as well as by its own average over realizations of this noise. We call these systems the Lagrangian averaged stochastic advection by Lie transport (LA SALT) equations. These equations are nonlinear and non-local, in both physical and probability space. Before taking this average, the equations recover the Stochastic Advection by Lie Transport (SALT) fluid equations introduced by Holm (Proc R Soc A 471(2176):20140963, 2015). Remarkably, the introduction of the non-locality in probability space in the form of momentum transported by its own mean velocity gives rise to a closed equation for the expectation field which comprises Navier--Stokes equations with Lie--Laplacian `dissipation'. As such, this form of non-locality provides a regularization mechanism. The formalism we develop is closely connected to the stochastic Weber velocity framework of Constantin and Iyer (Commun Pure Appl Math 61(3):330--345, 2008) in the case when the noise correlates are taken to be the constant basis vectors in \$\${\textbackslash}mathbb \{R\}{\textasciicircum}3\$\$and, thus, the Lie--Laplacian reduces to the usual Laplacian. We extend this class of equations to allow for advected quantities to be present and affect the flow through exchange of kinetic and potential energies. The statistics of the solutions for the LA SALT fluid equations are found to be changing dynamically due to an array of intricate correlations among the physical variables. The statistical properties of the LA SALT physical variables propagate as local evolutionary equations which when spatially integrated become dynamical equations for the variances of the fluctuations. Essentially, the LA SALT theory is a non-equilibrium stochastic linear response theory for fluctuations in SALT fluids with advected quantities.},

  abstract = {A new dynamical subgrid model for turbulent flow in the surface layer of the planetary boundary layer is presented. In this formulation, the flow is decomposed into small (subgrid) and large (resolved) scales in the spirit of large-eddy simulation. The subgrid model, however, is derived directly from the governing equations and involves no adjustable parameters. The evolution of the small scales is not postulated, but computed as a function of the large scales using a semiclassical method extending rapid distortion theory to account for the intermittency of the small scales. At the same time, feedback from the small scales to the large scales can also be computed via the corresponding subgrid stresses. The model can be generalized to include other physical effects, and thus could potentially be used to estimate momentum and temperature fluxes in complex systems like the planetary boundary layer, which impacts larger-scale models. A priori tests using 3D large-eddy and direct simulations of unstable, neutral, and stable flows support the assumptions in the model.},

  abstract = {Parameters in climate models are usually calibrated manually, exploiting only small subsets of the available data. This precludes both optimal calibration and quantification of uncertainties. Traditional Bayesian calibration methods that allow uncertainty quantification are too expensive for climate models; they are also not robust in the presence of internal climate variability. For example, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods typically reEquire O(105) model runs and are sensitive to internal variability noise, rendering them infeasible for climate models. Here we demonstrate an approach to model calibration and uncertainty quantification that requiresEonly O(102 ) model runs and can accommodate internal climate variability. The approach consists of three stages: (a) a calibration stage uses variants of ensemble Kalman inversion to calibrate a model by minimizing mismatches between model and data statistics; (b) an emulation stage emulates the parameter-to-data map with Gaussian processes (GP), using the model runs in the calibration stage for training; (c) a sampling stage approximates the Bayesian posterior distributions by sampling the GP emulator with MCMC. We demonstrate the feasibility and computational efficiency of this calibrate-emulate-sample (CES) approach in a perfect-model setting. Using an idealized general circulation model, we estimate parameters in a simple convection scheme from synthetic data generated with the model. The CES approach generates probability distributions of the parameters that are good approximations of the Bayesian posteriors, at a fraction of the computational cost usually required to obtain them. Sampling from this approximate posterior allows the generation of climate predictions with quantified parametric uncertainties.},

  abstract = {The simplifications required to apply the Boussinesq approximation to compressible flow are compared with those in an incompressible fluid. The larger degree of approximation required to describe mass conservation in a stratified compressible fluid using the Boussinesq continuity equation has led to the development of several different sets of `anelastic' equations that may be regarded as generalizations of the original Boussinesq approximation. These anelastic systems filter sound waves while allowing a more accurate representation of non-acoustic perturbations in compressible flows than can be obtained using the Boussinesq system. The energy conservation properties of several anelastic systems are compared under the assumption that the perturbations of the thermodynamic variables about a hydrostatically balanced reference state are small. The `pseudo-incompressible' system is shown to conserve total kinetic and anelastic dry static energy without requiring modification to any governing equation except the mass continuity equation. In contrast, other energy conservative anelastic systems also require additional approximations in other governing equations. The pseudo-incompressible system includes the effects of temperature changes on the density in the mass conservation equation, whereas this effect is neglected in other anelastic systems. A generalization of the pseudo-incompressible equation is presented and compared with the diagnostic continuity equation for quasi-hydrostatic flow in a transformed coordinate system in which the vertical coordinate is solely a function of pressure.

Conservation equations for each compartment are derived based on integrated versions of the radiative transfer equation of weakly interacting waves. The compartments interact with each other by the scattering of tidal energy to the wave continuum by triad wave--wave interactions, which are strongly enhanced equatorward of 288 due to parametric subharmonic instability of the tide and by scattering to the continuum of both tidal and near-inertial wave energy over rough topography and at continental margins. Global numerical simulations of the resulting model using observed stratification, forcing functions, and bottom topography yield good agreement with available observations.},

This treatment of thermodynamics allows for a closed and explicit formulation of conservation equations for dynamic and potential reservoirs of both enthalpy and internal energy, which differentiate approximately reversible from irreversible effects on internal energy, and allows for a formulation of a closed energy cycle on which energetically consistent ocean models can be based on.},

  abstract = {The equations of reversible (inviscid, adiabatic) fluid dynamics have a well-known variational formulation based on Hamilton's principle and the Lagrangian, to which is associated a Hamiltonian formulation that involves a Poisson bracket structure. However, real flows also include irreversible processes, such as viscous dissipation, heat conduction, diffusion and phase changes. Recent work has demonstrated that the variational formulation can be systematically extended to include irreversible processes and nonequilibrium thermodynamics, through the new concept of thermodynamic displacement. Irreversible processes have also been incorporated into the bracket structure through the addition of a dissipation bracket. This gives what are known as the single and double generator bracket formulations, which are the natural generalizations of the Hamiltonian formulation to include irreversible dynamics. Unlike the variational formalism, most of these bracket formalisms do not follow from a systematic construction and have often been derived via a case by case approach, with slightly different axioms used in different situations. In this paper, we show that the variational formulation yields a constructive and systematic way to derive from a unified perspective these bracket formulations for fully compressible, multicomponent, multiphase fluids with a single temperature and velocity. In the case of a linear relation between the thermodynamic fluxes and the thermodynamic forces, the metriplectic or GENERIC brackets are recovered. Many previous results in the literature, typically obtained via heuristic approaches, are demonstrated to be special cases of this general formulation.},

Semi-compressible fluids are useful in describing low-Mach dynamics, since they are soundproof . These models find wide use in many areas of fluid dynamics, including both geophysical and astrophysical fluid dynamics. Specifically, the Boussinesq, anelastic and pseudoincompressible equations are developed through a unified treatment valid for arbitrary Riemannian manifolds, thermodynamic potentials and geopotentials. By design, these formulations obey the 1st and 2nd laws of thermodynamics, ensuring their thermodynamic consistency. This general approach extends and unifies existing work, and helps clarify the thermodynamics of semi-compressible fluids. To further this goal, evolution equations are presented for a wide range of thermodynamic variables: entropy density s, specific entropy {$\eta$}, buoyancy b, temperature T, potential temperature {\texttheta} and a generic entropic variable {$\chi$}; along with a general definition of buoyancy valid for all three semicompressible models and arbitrary geopotentials. Finally, the elliptic equation for the pressure perturbation (the Lagrange multiplier that enforces semicompressibility) is developed for all three equation sets in the case of reversible dynamics, and for the Boussinesq/anelastic equations in the case of irreversible dynamics; and some discussion is given of the difficulty in formulating it for the pseudoincompressible equations with irreversible dynamics.},

It is shown that, in general, the horizontal velocities attained by the tube are comparable to those of the mean flow and that vertical velocities of up to a few meters per second are possible. The tube ascends slantwise in such a way that its buoyancy remains nearly zero, unless the environment is my very nearly moist adiabatic, in which case ascent at an angle of 45{$^\circ$} to the vertical is preferred. Results of the analysis support the contentions of Bennetts and Hoskins and Emanual that moist symmetric instability is the cause of some mesoscale rainbands. In a companion paper, it is demonstrated that the stability of the moist baroclinic atmosphere to two-dimensional slantwise displacements of arbitrary magnitude can be approximately assessed by reversibly lifting parcel along surfaces of constant angular momentum and comparing their density with that of their environment.},

In order to give a positive answer to this question, we prove that if the manifold under consideration is an immersed submanifold of the vector space, considered as ambient manifold, then it is possible to construct explicitly a reduced-order vector field over this submanifold. In particular, we found that the reduced-order vector field satisfies the variational principle of Dirac--Frenkel and that we can formulate the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition under this framework. Finally, we propose a local-point estimator of the time-dependent error between the original vector field and the reduced-order one.},

  abstract = {In the framework of the second phase of the Coordinated Ocean-ice Reference Experiments (CORE-II), we present an analysis of the representation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and Southern Ocean meridional overturning circulation (MOC) in a suite of seventeen global ocean--sea ice models. We focus on the mean, variability and trends of both the ACC and MOC over the 1958--2007 period, and discuss their relationship with the surface forcing. We aim to quantify the degree of eddy saturation and eddy compensation in the models participating in CORE-II, and compare our results with available observations, previous fine-resolution numerical studies and theoretical constraints. Most models show weak ACC transport sensitivity to changes in forcing during the past five decades, and they can be considered to be in an eddy saturated regime. Larger contrasts arise when considering MOC trends, with a majority of models exhibiting significant strengthening of the MOC during the late 20th and early 21st century. Only a few models show a relatively small sensitivity to forcing changes, responding with an intensified eddy-induced circulation that provides some degree of eddy compensation, while still showing considerable decadal trends. Both ACC and MOC interannual variabilities are largely controlled by the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). Based on these results, models are clustered into two groups. Models with constant or two-dimensional (horizontal) specification of the eddy-induced advection coefficient {$\kappa$} show larger ocean interior decadal trends, larger ACC transport decadal trends and no eddy compensation in the MOC. Eddy-permitting models or models with a three-dimensional time varying {$\kappa$} show smaller changes in isopycnal slopes and associated ACC trends, and partial eddy compensation. As previously argued, a constant in time or space {$\kappa$} is responsible for a poor representation of mesoscale eddy effects and cannot properly simulate the sensitivity of the ACC and MOC to changing surface forcing. Evidence is given for a larger sensitivity of the MOC as compared to the ACC transport, even when approaching eddy saturation. Future process studies designed for disentangling the role of momentum and buoyancy forcing in driving the ACC and MOC are proposed.},

Relevant data from other numerical simulations, water tank experiments, and atmospheric measurements are also incorporated in the analysis. Simulations have been performed for 10 values of the buoyancy gradient in the free atmosphere covering a typical atmospheric stability range. The entrainment parameters derived from LES and relationships between them are found to be sensitive to the model framework employed for their interpretation. Methods of determining bulk model entrainment parameters from the LES output are proposed and discussed. Within the range of investigated free-atmosphere stratifications, the LES predictions of the inversion height and buoyancy increment across the inversion are found to be close to the analytical solutions for the equilibrium entrainment regime, which is realized when the rate of time change of the CBL-mean turbulence kinetic energy and the energy drain from the CBL top are both negligibly small. The zero-order model entrainment ratio of about 0.2 for this regime is generally supported by the LES data. However, the zero-order parameterization of the entrainment layer thickness is found insufficient. A set of relationships between the general-structure entrainment parameters for typical atmospheric stability conditions is retrieved from the LES. Dimensionless constants in these relationships are estimated from the LES and laboratory data. Power-law approximations for relationships between the entrainment parameters in the zero-order jump and general-structure bulk models are evaluated based on the conducted LES. In the regime of equilibrium entrainment, the stratification parameter of the entrainment layer, which is the ratio of the buoyancy gradient in the free atmosphere to the overall buoyancy gradient across the entrainment layer, appears to be a constant of about 1.2.},

  abstract = {We consider a homogeneous plasma composed of N particles of the same electric charge which interact through a Coulomb potential. In the large plasma parameter limit, classical kinetic theories justify that the empirical density is the solution of the Balescu--Guernsey--Lenard equation, at leading order. This is a law of large numbers. The Balescu--Guernsey--Lenard equation is approximated by the Landau equation for scales much smaller than the Debye length. In order to describe typical and rare fluctuations, we compute for the first time a large deviation principle for dynamical paths of the empirical density, within the Landau approximation. We obtain a large deviation Hamiltonian that describes fluctuations and rare excursions of the empirical density, in the large plasma parameter limit. We obtain this large deviation Hamiltonian either from the Boltzmann large deviation Hamiltonian in the grazing collision limit, or directly from the dynamics, extending the classical kinetic theory for plasmas within the Landau approximation. We also derive the large deviation Hamiltonian for the empirical density of N particles, each of which is governed by a Markov process, and coupled in a mean field way. We explain that the plasma large deviation Hamiltonian is not the one of N particles coupled in a mean-field way.},

The Dynamically Orthogonal (DO) approximation is the canonical reduced order model for which the corresponding vector field is the orthogonal projection of the original system dynamics onto the tangent spaces of this manifold. The embedded geometry of the fixed rank matrix manifold is thoroughly analyzed. The curvature of the manifold is characterized and related to the smallest singular value through the study of the Weingarten map. Differentiability results for the orthogonal projection onto embedded manifolds are reviewed and used to derive an explicit dynamical system for tracking the truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of a time-dependent matrix. It is demonstrated that the error made by the DO approximation remains controlled under the minimal condition that the original solution stays close to the low rank manifold, which translates into an explicit dependence of this error on the gap between singular values. The DO approximation is also justified as the dynamical system that applies instantaneously the SVD truncation to optimally constrain the rank of the reduced solution. Riemannian matrix optimization is investigated in this extrinsic framework to provide algorithms that adaptively update the best low rank approximation of a smoothly varying matrix. The related gradient flow provides a dynamical system that converges to the truncated SVD of an input matrix for almost every initial data.},

The investigations were performed over a wide range of bottom buoyancy fluxes q0 and rotation rates {\textohm}, including {\textohm} = 0; q0 and {\textohm} were held constant during each experiment. The depth of the water column H was fixed for the entire experimental programme. For the non-rotating experiments, the r.m.s. velocity fluctuations were found to scale well with the convective velocity \$w\_* = (q\_0 H){\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{3\}\}\$, while the mean and r.m.s. fluctuations of buoyancy were found to scale with q0/w*. The spectra of temperature fluctuations were measured and were used to assess the applicability of two types of scaling, one of which is advanced in the present study.For the rotating experiments, the convective-layer growth is affected by the rotation at a height hc {$\approx$} 4.5(q0{\textohm}-3){$\frac{1}{2}$}. The r.m.s. horizontal velocity of the rotationally affected mixed layer is uniform throughout the mixed layer and is given by \$({\textbackslash}overline\{u{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime 2\}\}){\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{2\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm r\}{\textbackslash}approx 1.7(q\_0{\textbackslash}Omega{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}){\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{2\}\}\$.

Explanations for this have previously been based on wind-shear effects on the turbulence kinetic energy. By distinguishing between turbulent and non-turbulent regions, we provide an alternative explanation based on two competing wind-shear effects: the initial decrease in the correlation between buoyancy and vertical velocity fluctuations, and the increase in the turbulent area fraction. The former is determined by the change in the dominant forcing; without wind shear, buoyancy fluctuations drive vertical velocity fluctuations and the two are thus highly correlated; with wind shear, vertical velocity fluctuations are partly determined by horizontal velocity fluctuations via the transfer of kinetic energy through the pressure--strain correlation, thus reducing their correlation with the buoyancy field. The increasing turbulent area fraction, on the other hand, is determined by the increasing shear production of turbulence kinetic energy inside the entrainment zone. We also show that the dependence of these conditional statistics on the boundary-layer depth and on the magnitude of the wind shear can be captured by a single non-dimensional variable, which can be interpreted as an entrainment-zone Froude number.},

We close by surveying recent results in the literature for the NS-{$\alpha$} model and its inviscid limit (the Euler-{$\alpha$} model).},

The parameterization is cast as an overturning streamfunction that is proportional to the product of horizontal buoyancy gradient, mixed layer depth, and inertial period. The parameterization has remarkable skill for an extremely wide range of mixed layer depths, rotation rates, and vertical and horizontal stratifications. In this paper a coarse resolution prognostic model of the parameterization is compared with submesoscale mixed layer eddy resolving simulations. The parameterization proves accurate in predicting changes to the buoyancy. The climate implications of the proposed parameterization are estimated by applying the restratification scaling to observations: the mixed layer depth is estimated from climatology, and the buoyancy gradients are from satellite altimetry. The vertical fluxes are comparable to monthly mean air--sea fluxes in large areas of the ocean and suggest that restratification by mixed layer eddies is a leading order process in the upper ocean. Critical regions for ocean--atmosphere interaction, such as deep, intermediate, and mode water formation sites, are particularly affected.},

In this paper a parameterization for the restratification driven by finite-amplitude baroclinic instabilities of the mixed layer is proposed in terms of an overturning streamfunction that tilts isopycnals from the vertical to the horizontal. The streamfunction is proportional to the product of the horizontal density gradient, the mixed layer depth squared, and the inertial period. Hence restratification proceeds faster at strong fronts in deep mixed layers with a weak latitude dependence. In this paper the parameterization is theoretically motivated, confirmed to perform well for a wide range of mixed layer depths, rotation rates, and vertical and horizontal stratifications. It is shown to be superior to alternative extant parameterizations of baroclinic instability for the problem of mixed layer restratification.

A direct stochastic modelling scheme that is more generally applicable to complex models is then described and applied to LESs of quasigeostrophic turbulence of the atmosphere and oceans. We discuss the fundamental difference between atmospheric and oceanic LESs which is related to the difference in the deformation scales in the two classes of flows. We point out why the stochastic approach may be crucial when baroclinic instability is inadequately resolved. Finally, we discuss the application of inhomogeneous closure theory to the complex problem of flow over topography, and show that it can be used to understand the successes and limitations of currently used heuristic schemes and to provide a basis for further developments in the future.},

  abstract = {Abstract A parameterization formulation for incorporating the effects of midlatitude deep convection into mesoscale-numerical models is presented. The formulation is based on the hypothesis that the buoyant energy available to a parcel, in combination with a prescribed period of time for the convection to remove that energy, can be used to regulate the amount of convection in a mesoscale numerical model grid element. Individual clouds are represented as entraining moist updraft and downdraft plumes. The fraction of updraft condensate evaporated in moist downdrafts is determined from an empirical relationship between the vertical shear of the horizontal wind and precipitation efficiency. Vertical transports of horizontal momentum and warming by compensating subsidence are included in the parameterization. Since updraft and downdraft areas are sometimes a substantial fraction of mesoscale model grid-element areas, grid-point temperatures (adjusted for convection) are an area-weighted mean of updraft, downdraft and environmental temperatures.},

For example, simple first-order closure schemes such as the K-Profile Parameterization (KPP) lack energetic constraints; two-equation models like k-{$\varepsilon$} {\textbackslash}k-{\textbackslash}varepsilon {\textbackslash} directly solve an equation for the turbulent kinetic energy but do not account for non-diffusive fluxes, and high-order closures that include the high-order transport terms are computationally expensive. To address these, we extend the Assumed-Distribution Higher-Order Closure (ADC) framework originally proposed for the atmospheric boundary layer and apply it to the ocean surface boundary layer. By assuming a probability distribution function relationship between the vertical velocity and tracers, all second-order and higher-order moments are exactly constructed and turbulence closure is achieved in the ADC scheme. In addition, this ADC parameterization has full energetic constraints and includes non-diffusive fluxes without the computational cost of a full higher-order closure scheme. We have tested the ADC scheme against a combination of large eddy simulation (LES), KPP, and k-{$\varepsilon$} {\textbackslash}k-{\textbackslash}varepsilon {\textbackslash} for surface buoyancy-driven convective mixing and found that the ADC scheme is robust with different vertical resolutions and compares well to the LES results.},

  abstract = {Abstract The entrainment zone (EZ) of a dry, shear-free convective boundary layer growing into a linearly stratified fluid is studied by means of direct numerical simulation. The scale separation between the boundary layer thickness and the Kolmogorov length scale is shown to be sufficient to observe Reynolds number similarity in the statistics of interest during the equilibrium entrainment regime. Contrary to previous considerations, the vertical structure of the entrainment zone is found to be better described by the superposition of two sublayers: 1) an upper EZ sublayer that is dominated by overshooting thermals and is characterized by a penetration depth that scales with the ratio of the convective velocity and the buoyancy frequency of the free troposphere and 2) a lower EZ sublayer that is dominated by troughs of mixed fluid and is characterized by the integral length scale of the mixed layer. Correspondingly, different buoyancy scales are identified. The consequences of this multiplicity of scales on the entrainment rate parameters are evaluated directly, without resorting to any bulk model, through an exact relation among the mean entrainment rate, the local buoyancy increment, and both the turbulent and the finite-thickness contributions to the entrainment ratio A measured at the height of minimum buoyancy flux. The smaller turbulent contribution to A that is usually observed for relatively thick EZs is found to be compensated by the smaller local buoyancy increment instead of by the finite-thickness contribution. The two-layer structure of the entrainment zone is found to affect the exponent of the power-law relation between the normalized mean entrainment rate and the convective Richardson number such that the exponent deviates from -1 for typical atmospheric conditions, although it asymptotically approaches -1 for higher Richardson numbers.},

We use the thermodynamical consistent variable density model proposed in Abels et al. (Mathematical Models and Methods in Applied Sciences 22:1150013, 2012). This results in a Cahn--Hilliard-/Navier--Stokes-type system which we complement with tangential Dirichlet boundary conditions to incorporate the effect of wind in the atmosphere. Wind is responsible for waves at the surface of the ocean, whose dynamics have an important impact on the CO2---exchange between ocean and atmosphere. We tackle this mathematical model numerically with fully adaptive and integrated numerical schemes tailored to the simulation of variable density multiphase flows governed by diffuse interface models. Here, fully adaptive, integrated, efficient, and reliable means that the mesh resolution is chosen by the numerical algorithm according to a prescribed error tolerance in the a posteriori error control on the basis of residual-based error indicators, which allow to estimate the true error from below (efficient) and from above (reliable). Our approach is based on the work of Hinterm{\"u}ller et al. (Journal of Computational Physics 235:810--827, 2013), Garcke et al. (Applied Numerical Mathematics 99:151--171, 2016), where a fully adaptive efficient and reliable numerical method for the simulation of two-dimensional multiphase flows with variable densities is developed.

Dr. Garratt emphasizes the application of the ABL problems to numerical modeling of the climate, which makes this book unique among recent texts on the subject. He begins with a brief introduction to the ABL before leading to the development of mean and turbulence equations and the many scaling laws and theories that are the cornerstone of any serious ABL treatment. Modeling of the ABL is crucially dependent for its realism on the surface boundary conditions, so chapters four and five deal with aerodynamic and energy considerations, with attention given to both dry and wet land surfaces and the sea. The author next treats the structure of the clear-sky, thermally stratified ABL, including the convective and stable cases over homogeneous land, the marine ABL, and the internal boundary layer at the coastline. Chapter seven then extends this discussion to the cloudy ABL. This is particularly relevant to current research because the extensive stratocumulus regions over the subtropical oceans and stratus regions over the Arctic have been identified as key players in the climate system. In the final chapters, Dr. Garratt summarizes the book's material by discussing appropriate ABL and surface parameterization schemes in general circulation models of the atmosphere that are being used for climate stimulation.},

  abstract = {Abstract In a previous paper, Clarke and Gascard argued that the formation of Labrador Sea Water was taking place in a cyclonic gyre set up each winter in the western Labrador Sea. Within the gyre and at its boundaries, a number of different scales of organization are believed to be important in the formation processes. The longest of these scales is the mesoscale (50 km), which appears to be related to topographic Rossby waves generated in the Labrador Current and propagating offshore. The next smaller scale is an eddy scale (20 km) believed to arise because the mesoscale is baroclinically unstable, as shown by applying a two-layer model of Tang. This instability is believed to promote mixing by generating frontal structures and vertical motions along them, thus bringing subsurface T-S maxima nearer the surface. Then within the mesoscale and eddy-scale structures, intense vertical convective cells take place at scales which are probably of the order of 1 km in three dimensions. These events are short-lived and occur in response to particularly intense air-sea exchanges. Most of these processes have already been recognized in the Mediterranean Sea (MEDOC): that is, baroclinic instability of mesoscale features generating mixing at an eddy scale which is quite small because the scale is related to the internal radius of deformation (5--10 km). What is new is the link between the unstable mesoscale structures and the large-scale general circulation through the generation of topographic Rossby waves.},

Here we present tracer, float and hydrographic observations of long-lived ({$\sim$}1 year) and compact ({$\sim$}5\,km core diameter) vortices that reach down to depths of 2\,km. The eddies form in winter, near the rim of the Greenland Sea central gyre, and rotate clockwise with periods of a few days. The cores of the observed eddies are constituted from a mixture of modified Atlantic water that is warm and salty with polar water that is cold and fresh. We infer that these submesoscale coherent eddies contribute substantially to the input of Atlantic and polar waters to depths greater than 500\,m in the central Greenland Sea.},

  abstract = {A simple eddy kinetic energy parameterization of the oceanic vertical mixing is presented. The parameterization scheme is based on recent works on atmospheric turbulence modeling. It is designed to simulate vertical mixing at all depths, from the upper boundary layer down to the abyss. This scheme includes a single prognostic equation for the turbulent kinetic energy. The computation of the turbulent length scales is diagnostic, rather than prognostic. In weakly turbulent regions the simulated vertical diffusivity is inversely proportional to the Brunt-Va{\"i}sala frequency. In the first validation experiments presented here, the vertical mixing scheme is embedded into a simple one-dimensional model and used for upper ocean simulations at two very different test sites: the station Papa in the Gulf of Alaska and the Long-Term Upper Ocean Study (LOTUS) mooring in the Sargasso Sea. At station Papa the model successfully simulates the seasonal evolution of the upper ocean temperature field. At LOTUS the focus is on a short 2-week period. A detailed analysis of the oceanic heat budget during that period reveals a large bias in the bulk-derived surface heat fluxes. After correction of the fluxes the model does well in simulating the evolution of the temperature and wind-driven current. In particular, the large observed diurnal cycles of the sea surface temperature are well reproduced. During the second (windy) week of the selected period the model accounts for about two thirds of the kinetic energy of the observed upper ocean currents at periods larger than 6 hours. The local wind forcing thus appears to be the dominant generation mechanism for the near-inertial motions, which are the most energetic. The velocity simulation is especially good at the low frequencies. During the second simulated week the model accounts for as much as 78\% of the kinetic energy at subinertial frequencies. The simulated mean velocity profile is reminiscent of an Ekman spiral, in agreement with the observations.},

In Part II, we develop this formulation for the case of continuum systems by extending the setting of Part I to infinite dimensional nonholonomic Lagrangian systems. The variational formulation is naturally expressed in the material representation, while its spatial version is obtained via a nonholonomic Lagrangian reduction by symmetry. The theory is illustrated with the examples of a viscous heat conducting fluid and its multicomponent extension including chemical reactions and mass transfer.},

The same turbulent flow dynamics and ablation rate are expected to apply at any depth in a deeper ocean water column (after choosing the relevant pressure coefficient for the liquidus temperature). At Grashof numbers currently accessible by direct numerical simulation, turbulence is generated both directly from buoyancy flux and from shear production in the buoyancy-driven boundary layer flow, whereas shear production by the convective flow is expected to be more important at geophysical scales. The momentum balance in the boundary layer is dominated by buoyancy forcing and wall stress, with the latter characterised by a large drag coefficient.},

That paper was highlighted at the CLIVAR Working Group on Ocean Model Development ``Workshop on Ocean Mesoscale Eddies'' which was held at the UK Meteorological Office in April 2009, and this review paper is based on the talk given at that Workshop. It contains some hindsights on how the parameterization of the effect of mesoscale eddies on the mean flow came about; which is a question that I am asked quite often. A few important results from including the parameterization in a non-eddy-resolving ocean model are recalled. Including this parameterization, along with other improvements to all the components, in the first version of the Community Climate System Model resulted in the first non-drifting control simulation in a climate model that did not require flux corrections. Also included are brief comments on how the Gent and McWilliams eddy parameterization has been modified and improved since the original proposal in 1990.},

This review deals with the consequences of abandoning the TA, based on evidence from numerical and theoretical studies and laboratory and field experiments. The phenomena most affected by the TA include mesoscale flows (Ekman spirals, deep convection, and equatorial jets) and internal waves. Abandoning the TA produces a tilt in convective plumes, produces a dependence on wind direction in Ekman spirals, and gives rise to a plethora of changes in internal wave behavior in weakly stratified layers, such as the existence of trapped short low-frequency waves, and a poleward extension of their habitat. In the astrophysical context of stars and gas giant planets, the TA affects the rate of tidal dissipation and also the patterns of thermal convection.},

  abstract = {Many fluctuation-driven phenomena in fluids can be analysed effectively using the generalised Lagrangian-mean (GLM) theory of Andrews \& McIntyre (               J. Fluid Mech.               , vol.~89, 1978, pp.~609--646) This finite-amplitude theory relies on particle-following averaging to incorporate the constraints imposed by the material conservation of certain quantities in inviscid regimes. Its original formulation, in terms of Cartesian coordinates, relies implicitly on an assumed Euclidean structure; as a result, it does not have a geometrically intrinsic, coordinate-free interpretation on curved manifolds, and suffers from undesirable features. Motivated by this, we develop a geometric generalisation of GLM that we formulate intrinsically using coordinate-free notation. One benefit is that the theory applies to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds; another is that it establishes a clear distinction between results that stem directly from geometric consistency and those that depend on particular choices. Starting from a decomposition of an ensemble of flow maps into mean and perturbation, we define the Lagrangian-mean momentum as the average of the pull-back of the momentum one-form by the perturbation flow maps. We show that it obeys a simple equation which guarantees the conservation of Kelvin's circulation, irrespective of the specific definition of the mean flow map. The Lagrangian-mean momentum is the integrand in Kelvin's circulation and distinct from the mean velocity (the time derivative of the mean flow map) which advects the contour of integration. A pseudomomentum consistent with that in GLM can then be defined by subtracting the Lagrangian-mean momentum from the one-form obtained from the mean velocity using the manifold's metric. The definition of the mean flow map is based on choices made for reasons of convenience or aesthetics. We discuss four possible definitions: a direct extension of standard GLM, a definition based on optimal transportation, a definition based on a geodesic distance in the group of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms, and the `glm' definition proposed by Soward \& Roberts (               J. Fluid Mech.               , vol.~661, 2010, pp.~45--72). Assuming small-amplitude perturbations, we carry out order-by-order calculations to obtain explicit expressions for the mean velocity and Lagrangian-mean momentum at leading order. We also show how the wave-action conservation of GLM extends to the geometric setting. To make the paper self-contained, we introduce in some detail the tools of differential geometry and main ideas of geometric fluid dynamics on which we rely. These include variational formulations which we use for alternative derivations of some key results. We mostly focus on the Euler equations for incompressible inviscid fluids but sketch out extensions to the rotating--stratified Boussinesq, compressible Euler, and magnetohydrodynamic equations. We illustrate our results with an application to the interaction of inertia-gravity waves with balanced mean flows in rotating--stratified fluids.},

  abstract = {A new one-dimensional (1-D) parameterization of penetrative convection has been developed in order to have a better representation of the vertical mixing in ocean general circulation models. Our approach is inspired from atmospheric parameterizations of shallow convection which assumes that in the convective boundary layer, the subgrid-scale fluxes result from two different mixing scales: small eddies, which are represented by an Eddy-Diffusivity (ED) contribution, and large eddies associated with thermals, which are represented by a mass-flux contribution. In the present work, the local (small eddies) and nonlocal (large eddies) contributions are unified into an Eddy-Diffusivity-Mass-Flux (EDMF) parameterization which treats simultaneously the whole vertical mixing. EDMF is implemented in the community ocean model NEMO and tested in its 1-D column version. Deepening of dense water in analytic cases, successfully reproduced in LES simulations, is more realistic with EDMF than with standard diffusion parameterizations. Also the convective events observed in the western Mediterranean at the Lion station and in the North Pacific Ocean at the PAPA station are more realistic in terms of sequencing and amplitude with EDMF.},

The cloud-base mass flux is obtained from a simplifed turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) budget for the sub-cloud layer, in which cumulus convection is assumed to be associated with a transport of TKE from the sub-cloud layer to the cloud layer. The heat and moisture fluxes are obtained from a jump model based on the virtual-potential-temperature equation. A key part of this parametrization is the parametrization of the virtual-temperature flux at the top of the transition zone between the sub-cloud and cloud layers. It is argued that pressure fluctuations must be responsible for the transport of TKE from the cloud layer to the sub-cloud layer.},

  abstract = {Numerical weather, climate, or Earth system models involve the coupling of components. At a broad level, these components can be classified as the resolved fluid dynamics, unresolved fluid dynamical aspects (i.e., those represented by physical parameterizations such as subgrid-scale mixing), and nonfluid dynamical aspects such as radiation and microphysical processes. Typically, each component is developed, at least initially, independently. Once development is mature, the components are coupled to deliver a model of the required complexity. The implementation of the coupling can have a significant impact on the model. As the error associated with each component decreases, the errors introduced by the coupling will eventually dominate. Hence, any improvement in one of the components is unlikely to improve the performance of the overall system. The challenges associated with combining the components to create a coherent model are here termed physics--dynamics coupling. The issue goes beyond the coupling between the parameterizations and the resolved fluid dynamics. This paper highlights recent progress and some of the current challenges. It focuses on three objectives: to illustrate the phenomenology of the coupling problem with references to examples in the literature, to show how the problem can be analyzed, and to create awareness of the issue across the disciplines and specializations. The topics addressed are different ways of advancing full models in time, approaches to understanding the role of the coupling and evaluation of approaches, coupling ocean and atmosphere models, thermodynamic compatibility between model components, and emerging issues such as those that arise as model resolutions increase and/or models use variable resolutions.},

We adopt the near-eutectic limit, making the problem analytically tractable using standard perturbation techniques. We consider also a distinguished limit of large Stefan number, which allows a destabilization of the system to an oscillatory mode of convection. We find that either travelling waves or standing waves can be supercritically stable, depending strongly on the sensitivity of permeability of the mushy layer to variations in the local solid fraction: mushy-layer systems with relatively weak sensitivity are more likely to select travelling waves rather than standing waves in the nonlinear regime. Furthermore, the decrease in permeability is found to promote the subcritical, and hence more unstable, primary oscillatory states. In addition to mapping out the location of different stable oscillatory patterns in the available parameter space, we give the detailed spatio-temporal structure of the corresponding thermal, flow and solid-fraction fields within the mushy layer, as well as the local bulk composition in the resulting eutectic solid.},

Here we reproduce the most recent polynya openings in 2016--2017 using a regional configuration, and assess their dependencies on vertical convective mixing schemes and freshwater forcing, both separately and in combination. We test three vertical convective mixing schemes: the enhanced vertical diffusion (EVD), the Eddy-Diffusivity Mass-Flux (EDMF) parameterization, and a modified version of EDMF accounting for thermobaric effects. Using simulations for the period 2007--2017, we find that the modified EDMF reproduces the observed climatological evolution of the mixed layer depth better than the original EDMF and the EVD, but a polynya fails to open due to excessive freshwater forcing. We thus use the modified EDMF to perform sensitivity experiments with reduced precipitation during 2012--2017. The imposed freshwater forcing strongly affects the number of years with polynyas. The simulation with the best representation of the 2016--2017 polynyas is analyzed to evaluate the triggering mechanisms. The 2016 polynya was induced by the action of thermobaric instabilities on a weak ambient stratification. This opening preconditioned the water column for 2017, which produced a stronger polynya. By examining the impacts of the different convective mixing schemes, we show that the modified EDMF generates more realistic patterns of deep convection. Our results highlight the importance of surface freshwater forcing and thermobaricity in governing deep convection around Maud Rise, and the need to represent thermobaric instabilities to realistically model Maud Rise polynyas.},

We show that the dependence of entrainment-zone properties on these two non-dimensional quantities can be expressed in terms of just one independent variable, the ratio between a shear scale                                                                      \$({\textbackslash}unicode[STIX]\{x0394\}z\_\{i\})\_\{s\}{\textbackslash}equiv {\textbackslash}sqrt\{1/3\}{\textbackslash}unicode[STIX]\{x0394\}u/N\_\{0\}\$                                               and a convective scale                                                                      \$({\textbackslash}unicode[STIX]\{x0394\}z\_\{i\})\_\{c\}{\textbackslash}equiv 0.25z\_\{enc\}\$                                               , where                                                                      \${\textbackslash}unicode[STIX]\{x0394\}u\$                                               is the velocity increment across the entrainment zone, and                                                                      \$N\_\{0\}\$                                               is the buoyancy frequency of the free atmosphere.

  abstract = {Abstract Two zero-order bulk models (ZOMs) are developed for the velocity, buoyancy, and moisture of a cloud-free barotropic convective boundary layer (CBL) that grows into a linearly stratified atmosphere. The models differ in the entrainment closure assumption: in the first one, termed the ``energetics-based model,'' the negative and positive areas of the buoyancy flux are assumed to match between the model and the actual CBL; in the second one, termed the ``geometric-based model,'' the modeled CBL depth is assumed to match different definitions of the actual CBL depth. Parameterizations for these properties derived from direct numerical simulation (DNS) are employed as entrainment closure equations. These parameterizations, and hence the resulting models, are free from the potential singularity at finite wind strength that has been a major limitation in previous bulk models. The proposed ZOMs are verified using the DNS data. Model results show that the CBL depths obtained from the energetics-based model and previous ZOMs correspond to the height that marks the transition from the lower to the upper entrainment-zone sublayer; this reference height is few hundred meters above the height of the minimum buoyancy flux. It is also argued that ZOMs, despite their simplicity compared to higher-order models, can accurately represent CBL bulk properties when the relevant features of the actual entrainment zone are considered in the entrainment closures. The vertical structure of the actual entrainment zone, if required, can be constructed a posteriori using the available relationships between the predicted zero-order CBL depth and various definitions of the actual CBL depth.},

  abstract = {Abstract The current operational eddy-diffusivity countergradient (EDCG) planetary boundary layer (PBL) scheme in the NCEP Global Forecast System (GFS) tends to underestimate the PBL growth in the convective boundary layer (CBL). To improve CBL growth, an eddy-diffusivity mass-flux (EDMF) PBL scheme is developed, where the nonlocal transport by large turbulent eddies is represented by a mass-flux (MF) scheme and the local transport by small eddies is represented by an eddy-diffusivity (ED) scheme. For the vertical momentum mixing, the MF scheme is modified to include the effect of the updraft-induced pressure gradient force. While the EDMF scheme displays better CBL growth than the EDCG scheme, it tends to overproduce the amount of low clouds and degrades wind vector forecasts over the tropical ocean where strongly unstable PBLs are rarely found. In order not to degrade the forecast skill in the tropics, a hybrid scheme is developed, where the EDMF scheme is applied only for the strongly unstable PBL, while the EDCG scheme is used for the weakly unstable PBL. Along with the hybrid EDMF scheme, the heating by turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) dissipation is parameterized to reduce an energy imbalance in the GFS. To enhance a too weak vertical turbulent mixing for weakly and moderately stable conditions, the current local scheme in the stable boundary layer (SBL) is modified to use an eddy-diffusivity profile method. The hybrid EDMF PBL scheme with TKE dissipative heating and modified SBL mixing led to significant improvements in some key medium-range weather forecast metrics and was operationally implemented into the NCEP GFS in January 2015.},

In the scheme, an MF approach is employed for the stratocumulus-top-driven downdrafts as well as for the thermals in the daytime unstable boundary layer. The scheme includes parameterizations for enhanced buoyancy due to moist adiabatic processes in condensation and for TKE interaction with cumulus convection. A scale-aware parameterization is proposed for the grid sizes where the large turbulent eddies are partially resolved. The single-column model (SCM) tests show that both the EDMF-TKE and the current operational NCEP GFS hybrid EDMF scheme (EDMF-CTL) simulate a daytime dry-convective boundary layer well and agree with a benchmark large-eddy simulation (LES). For a marine stratocumulus-topped boundary layer case, the EDMF-TKE better simulates the liquid water and wind speed profiles than the EDMF-CTL compared to the LES. For a stable boundary layer (SBL) case, the EDMF-TKE also agrees better with the LES than the EDMF-CTL, although it tends to produce a deeper SBL compared to the LES. On the other hand, three-dimensional medium-range forecast experiments show that the EDMF-TKE slightly improves forecast skill in the 500-hPa height anomaly correlation and wind vector, while it has a neutral impact on precipitation forecasts over the continental United States.},

  abstract = {Ocean modeling presents several unique technical challenges: there is a tremendous range of spatial scales; the kinetic energy forcing scale occurs at the Rossby radius of deformation (20--100 km), which is often at or below the grid resolution; and mixing is strongly anisotropic, occurring primarily along nearly horizontal isopycnal surfaces. We present analysis and numerical results to show that the Lagrangian-averaged Navier--Stokes alpha (LANS-{$\alpha$}) turbulence parameterization and, to a lesser extent, the Leray parameterization are well suited to ocean modeling. LANS-{$\alpha$} and Leray are fundamentally different from purely dissipative turbulence models in that both LANS-{$\alpha$} and Leray are more energetic and produce more eddy structure near the gridscale. This is consistent with expectation from linear stability analysis, where it has been shown that these models resolve the process of baroclinic instability on coarser meshes than standard Navier--Stokes. Formulations of LANS-{$\alpha$} and Leray models for the primitive equations are presented. In an idealized ocean channel domain, LANS-{$\alpha$} produces turbulence statistics in kinetic energy, eddy kinetic energy and temperature distributions that resemble a doubled-resolution simulation without LANS-{$\alpha$}. Leray produces qualitatively similar results, but to a lesser degree than LANS-{$\alpha$}. Finally, the Leray model is tested in a North Atlantic domain with realistic topography and forcing, and produces higher kinetic and eddy kinetic energy than the non-Leray model.},

  abstract = {Abstract The growth and decay of a convective boundary layer (CBL) over a surface with a constant surface temperature that develops into a linear stratification is studied, and a mathematical model for this system is derived. The study is based on direct numerical simulations with four different Reynolds numbers; the two simulations with the largest Reynolds numbers display Reynolds number similarity, suggesting that the results can be extrapolated to the atmosphere. Because of the interplay of the growing CBL and the gradually decreasing surface buoyancy flux, the system has a complex time evolution in which integrated kinetic energy, buoyancy flux, and dissipation peak and subsequently decay. The derived model provides characteristic scales for bulk properties of the CBL. Even though the system is unsteady, self-similar vertical profiles of buoyancy, buoyancy flux, and velocity variances are recovered. There are two important implications for atmospheric modeling. First, the magnitude of the surface buoyancy flux sets the time scale of the system; thus, over a rough surface the roughness length is a key variable. Therefore, the performance of the surface model is crucial in large-eddy simulations of convection over water surfaces. Second, during the phase in which kinetic energy decays, the integrated kinetic energy never follows a power law, because the buoyancy flux and dissipation balance until the kinetic energy has almost vanished. Therefore, the applicability of power-law decay models to the afternoon transition in the atmospheric boundary layer is questionable; the presented model provides a physically sound alternative.},

  abstract = {Deep and bottom water formation are crucial components of the global ocean circulation, yet they were poorly represented in the previous generation of climate models. We here quantify biases in Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) and North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) formation, properties, transport, and global extent in 35 climate models that participated in the latest Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). Several CMIP6 models are correctly forming AABW via shelf processes, but 28 models in the Southern Ocean and all 35 models in the North Atlantic form deep and bottom water via open-ocean deep convection too deeply, too often, and/or over too large an area. Models that convect the least form the most accurate AABW but the least accurate NADW. The four CESM2 models with their overflow parameterisation are among the most accurate models. In the Atlantic, the colder the AABW, the stronger the abyssal overturning at 30{$\circ$} S, and the further north the AABW layer extends. The saltier the NADW, the stronger the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), and the further south the NADW layer extends. In the Indian and Pacific oceans in contrast, the fresher models are the ones which extend the furthest regardless of the strength of their abyssal overturning, most likely because they are also the models with the weakest fronts in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. There are clear improvements since CMIP5: several CMIP6 models correctly represent or parameterise Antarctic shelf processes, fewer models exhibit Southern Ocean deep convection, more models convect at the right location in the Labrador Sea, bottom density biases are reduced, and abyssal overturning is more realistic. However, more improvements are required, e.g. by generalising the use of overflow parameterisations or by coupling to interactive ice sheet models, before deep and bottom water formation, and hence heat and carbon storage, are represented accurately.},

Present-day temperature, salinity, sea ice concentration and ocean transport in the North Atlantic subpolar gyre and Nordic Seas from 23 CMIP5 (Climate Model Intercomparison Project, phase 5) models are compared with observations to assess the biases, causes and consequences of North Atlantic deep convection in models. The majority of models convect too deep, over too large an area, too often and too far south. Deep convection occurs at the sea ice edge and is most realistic in models with accurate sea ice extent, mostly those using the CICE model. Half of the models convect in response to local cooling or salinification of the surface waters; only a third have a dynamic relationship between freshwater coming from the Arctic and deep convection. The models with the most intense deep convection have the warmest deep waters, due to a redistribution of heat through the water column. For the majority of models, the variability of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is explained by the volumes of deep water produced in the subpolar gyre and Nordic Seas up to 2 years before. In turn, models with the strongest AMOC have the largest heat export to the Arctic. Understanding the dynamical drivers of deep convection and AMOC in models is hence key to realistically forecasting Arctic oceanic warming and its consequences for the global ocean circulation, cryosphere and marine life.},

  abstract = {Stochastic parametrisations of the interactions among disparate scales of motion in fluid convection are often used for estimating prediction uncertainty, which can arise due to inadequate model resolution, or incomplete observations, especially in dealing with atmosphere and ocean dynamics, where viscous and diffusive dissipation effects are negligible. This paper derives a family of three different types of stochastic parameterisations for the classical Euler-Boussinesq (EBC) equations for a buoyant incompressible fluid flowing under gravity in a vertical plane. These three stochastic models are inspired by earlier work on the effects of stochastic fluctuations on transport, see, e.g., Kraichnan (1968, 1994) and Doering et~al.. (1994). They are derived here from variants of Hamilton's principle for the deterministic case when Stratonovich noise is introduced. The three models possess different variants of their corresponding Hamiltonian structures. One variant (SALT) introduces stochastic transport. Another variant (SFLT) introduces stochastic forcing, rather than stochastic transport. The third variant (LA SALT) introduces nonlocality in its stochastic transport, in the probabilistic sense of McKean (1966).},

The Legendre transformation in such cases is often not invertible; thus, it does not produce a corresponding Euler--Poincar{\'e} system on that Lie algebra. We avoid this potential difficulty by developing the theory of Euler--Poincar{\'e} systems entirely within the Lagrangian framework. We apply the general theory to a number of known examples, including the heavy top, ideal compressible fluids and MHD. We also use this framework to derive higher dimensional Camassa--Holm equations, which have many potentially interesting analytical properties.

Euler--Poincar{\textasciiacute}e equations (the Lagrangian analog of Lie-Poisson Hamiltonian equations) are derived for a parameter dependent Lagrangian from a general variational principle of Lagrange d'Alembert type in which variations are constrained; 2. an abstract Kelvin--Noether theorem is derived for such systems. By imposing suitable constraints on the variations and by using invariance properties of the Lagrangian, as one does for the Euler equations for the rigid body and ideal fluids, we cast several standard Eulerian models of geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD) at various levels of approximation into Euler-Poincar{\textasciiacute}e form and discuss their corresponding Kelvin--Noether theorems and potential vorticity conservation laws. The various levels of GFD approximation are related by substituting a sequence of velocity decompositions and asymptotic expansions into Hamilton's principle for the Euler equations of a rotating stratified ideal incompressible fluid. We emphasize that the shared properties of this sequence of approximate ideal GFD models follow directly from their Euler-Poincar{\textasciiacute}e formulations. New modifications of the Euler-Boussinesq equations and primitive equations are also proposed in which nonlinear dispersion adaptively filters high wavenumbers and thereby enhances stability and regularity without compromising either low wavenumber behavior or geophysical balances.},

  abstract = {We are modelling multiscale, multi-physics uncertainty in wave--current interaction (WCI). To model uncertainty in WCI, we introduce stochasticity into the wave dynamics of two classic models of WCI, namely the generalised Lagrangian mean (GLM) model and the Craik--Leibovich (CL) model. The key idea for the GLM approach is the separation of the Lagrangian (fluid) and Eulerian (wave) degrees of freedom in Hamilton's principle. This is done by coupling an Euler--Poincar{\'e} reduced Lagrangian for the current flow and a phase-space Lagrangian for the wave field. WCI in the GLM model involves the nonlinear Doppler shift in frequency of the Hamiltonian wave subsystem, which arises because the waves propagate in the frame of motion of the Lagrangian-mean velocity of the current. In contrast, WCI in the CL model arises because the fluid velocity is defined relative to the frame of motion of the Stokes mean drift velocity, which is usually taken to be prescribed, time independent and driven externally. We compare the GLM and CL theories by placing them both into the general framework of a stochastic Hamilton's principle for a 3D Euler--Boussinesq (EB) fluid in a rotating frame. In other examples, we also apply the GLM and CL methods to add wave physics and stochasticity to the familiar 1D and 2D shallow water flow models. The differences in the types of stochasticity which arise for GLM and CL models can be seen by comparing the Kelvin circulation theorems for the two models. The GLM model acquires stochasticity in its Lagrangian transport velocity for the currents and also in its group velocity for the waves. However, the CL model is based on defining the Eulerian velocity in the integrand of the Kelvin circulation relative to the Stokes drift velocity induced by waves driven externally. Thus, the Kelvin theorem for the stochastic CL model can accept stochasticity in its both its integrand and in the Lagrangian transport velocity of its circulation loop. In an ``Appendix'', we also discuss dynamical systems analogues of WCI.},

The paper proceeds by taking variations in the SVP to derive stochastic Stratonovich fluid equations; writing their It{\^o} representation; and then investigating the properties of these stochastic fluid models in comparison with each other, and with the corresponding deterministic fluid models. The circulation properties of the stochastic Stratonovich fluid equations are found to closely mimic those of the deterministic ideal fluid models. As with deterministic ideal flows, motion along the stochastic Stratonovich paths also preserves the helicity of the vortex field lines in incompressible stochastic flows. However, these Stratonovich properties are not apparent in the equivalent It{\^o} representation, because they are disguised by the quadratic covariation drift term arising in the Stratonovich to It{\^o} transformation. This term is a geometric generalization of the quadratic covariation drift term already found for scalar densities in Stratonovich's famous 1966 paper. The paper also derives motion equations for two examples of stochastic geophysical fluid dynamics; namely, the Euler--Boussinesq and quasi-geostropic approximations.},

  abstract = {Abstract To describe the heat and scalar fluxes in the convective boundary layer, we propose expressions for eddy diffusivities and countergradient terms. The latter expressions can be used in a modified flux-gradient approach, which takes account for nonlocal convective vertical exchange. The results for heat are based on a derivation similar to that of Deardorff by utilizing the turbulent heat-flux equation, but the closure assumptions applied to the heat-flux budgets are different. As a result, the physical interpretation for the countergradient term differs; our countergradient term results from the third-moment transport effect, while Deardorff's results from the buoyancy production term. On the basis of our analysis, we are able to calculate an eddy diffusivity for heat, using large-eddy simulation results. The results are presented in the form of a similarity profile, using the convective velocity scale w* and the inversion height zi. It is shown that the latter profile is well behaved and that it matches the results of surface-layer theory. Using the top-down and bottom-up decomposition, we have generalized our findings for any scalar, such as the moisture field or an air pollution contaminant. We show that the eddy diffusivity profile for scalar C is sensitive to the entrainment--surface flux ratio of C. Therefore, a different scalar field should have a different eddy-diffusivity profile. The proposed expressions for the eddy diffusivities and the countergradient terms are easy to apply in (large-scale) atmospheric and diffusion models.},

  abstract = {Recent increases in computing power mean that atmospheric models for numerical weather prediction are now able to operate at grid spacings of the order of a few hundred meters, comparable to the dominant turbulence length scales in the atmospheric boundary layer. As a result, models are starting to partially resolve the coherent overturning structures in the boundary layer. In this resolution regime, the so-called boundary layer ``gray zone,'' neither the techniques of high-resolution atmospheric modeling (a few tens of meters resolution) nor those of traditional meteorological models (a few kilometers resolution) are appropriate because fundamental assumptions behind the parameterizations are violated. Nonetheless, model simulations in this regime may remain highly useful. In this paper, a newly formed gray zone boundary layer community lays the basis for parameterizing gray zone turbulence, identifies the challenges in high-resolution atmospheric modeling and presents different gray zone boundary layer models. We discuss both the successful applications and the limitations of current parameterization approaches, and consider various issues in extending promising research approaches into use for numerical weather prediction. The ultimate goal of the research is the development of unified boundary layer parameterizations valid across all scales.},

Reference data for grid-scale and subgrid-scale fields at these resolutions are constructed by filtering 62.5-m large-eddy simulation data. A conditional sampling is adapted to detect subgrid thermals, and is used to characterize the subgrid thermals at several grid spacings in the grey zone. A mass-flux parametrization used in NWP models is compared with the subgrid thermal field. The analysis demonstrates that, although the mass-flux framework is suitable in the grey zone, some assumptions of the mass-flux schemes, usually used at the mesoscale, cannot be made in the grey zone. In particular, the thermal fraction is not small, the resolved vertical velocity is not negligible, the entrainment and detrainment rates depend on the horizontal resolution, the triggering and the closure at the surface are moreover random.},

Here we present results from direct numerical simulations of three representative set-ups: first, a fluid with Prandtl number                                                                      \$Pr=6.4\$                                               , corresponding to water, in a cylinder with a diameter-to-height aspect ratio of                                                                      \${\textbackslash}unicode[STIX]\{x1D6E4\}=2\$                                               ; second, a fluid with                                                                      \$Pr=0.8\$                                               , corresponding to                                                                      \${\textbackslash}text\{SF\}\_\{6\}\$                                               or air, confined in a slender cylinder with                                                                      \${\textbackslash}unicode[STIX]\{x1D6E4\}=0.5\$                                               ; and third, the main focus of this paper, a fluid with                                                                      \$Pr=0.025\$                                               , corresponding to a liquid metal, in a cylinder with                                                                      \${\textbackslash}unicode[STIX]\{x1D6E4\}=1.87\$                                               . The obtained flow fields are analysed using the sparsity-promoting variant of the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). By means of this technique, we extract the coherent structures that govern the dynamics of the flow, as well as their associated frequencies. In addition, we follow the temporal evolution of single modes and present a criterion to identify their direction of travel, i.e. whether they are precessing prograde or retrograde. We show that for moderate                                                                      \$Pr\$                                               a few dynamic modes suffice to accurately describe the flow. For large aspect ratios, these are wall-localised waves that travel retrograde along the periphery of the cylinder. Their DMD frequencies agree with the predictions of linear stability theory. With increasing Rayleigh number                                                                      \$Ra\$                                               , the interior gradually fills with columnar vortices, and eventually a regular pattern of convective Taylor columns prevails. For small aspect ratios and close enough to onset, the dominant flow structures are body modes that can precess either prograde or retrograde. For                                                                      \$Pr=0.8\$                                               , DMD additionally unveiled the existence of so far unobserved low-amplitude oscillatory modes. Furthermore, we elucidate the multi-modal character of oscillatory convection in low-                                                                      \$Pr\$                                               fluids. Generally, more dynamic modes must be retained to accurately approximate the flow. Close to onset, the flow is purely oscillatory and the DMD reveals that these high-frequency modes are a superposition of oscillatory columns and cylinder-scale inertial waves. We find that there are coexisting prograde and retrograde modes, as well as quasi-axisymmetric torsional modes. For higher                                                                      \$Ra\$                                               , the flow also becomes unstable to wall modes. These low-frequency modes can both coexist with the oscillatory modes, and also couple to them. However, the typical flow feature of rotating convection at moderate                                                                      \$Pr\$                                               , the quasi-steady Taylor vortices, is entirely absent in low-                                                                      \$Pr\$                                               flows.},

This process is usually named tuning in the climate modeling community. In climate models, the variety and complexity of physical processes involved, and their interplay through a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, must be summarized in a series of approximate submodels. Most submodels depend on uncertain parameters. Tuning consists of adjusting the values of these parameters to bring the solution as a whole into line with aspects of the observed climate. Tuning is an essential aspect of climate modeling with its own scientific issues, which is probably not advertised enough outside the community of model developers. Optimization of climate models raises important questions about whether tuning methods a priori constrain the model results in unintended ways that would affect our confidence in climate projections. Here, we present the definition and rationale behind model tuning, review specific methodological aspects, and survey the diversity of tuning approaches used in current climate models. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities in applying so-called objective methods in climate model tuning. We discuss how tuning methodologies may affect fundamental results of climate models, such as climate sensitivity. The article concludes with a series of recommendations to make the process of climate model tuning more transparent.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

For both LES and observations, the new scheme performs better at simulating entrainment fluxes at the top of the convective boundary layer and at near-surface conditions.

  abstract = {We demonstrate a new approach for climate model tuning in a realistic situation. Our approach, the mathematical foundations and technical details of which are given in Part I, systematically uses a single-column configuration of a global atmospheric model on test cases for which reference large-eddy-simulations are available. The space of free parameters is sampled running the single-column model from which metrics are estimated in the full parameter space using emulators. The parameter space is then reduced by retaining only the values for which the emulated metrics match large eddy simulations within a given tolerance to error. The approach is applied to the 6A version of the LMDZ model which results from a long investment in the development of physics parameterizations and by-hand tuning. The boundary layer is revisited by increasing the vertical resolution and varying parameters that were kept fixed so far, which improves the representation of clouds at process scale. The approach allows us to automatically reach a tuning of this modified configuration as good as that of the 6A version. We show how this approach helps accelerate the introduction of new parameterizations. It allows us to maintain the physical foundations of the model and to ensure that the improvement of global metrics is obtained for a reasonable behavior at process level, reducing the risk of error compensations that may arise from over-fitting some climate metrics. That is, we get things right for the right reasons.},

  abstract = {The representation of stratocumulus clouds, and of the stratocumulus to cumulus transitions which are ubiquitous features of marine boundary layer clouds, remains a challenge for climate models. We show how a mass flux representation of boundary layer convective structures combined with an eddy diffusivity scheme, the ``thermal plume model,'' first developed to represent cumulus clouds, can also adequately simulate stratocumulus and the stratocumulus to cumulus transition in a climate model. To achieve this, the detrainment formulation, in which detrainment increases for increasing negative buoyancy, has to be slightly modified: the buoyancy of a thermal plume parcel of air is computed by comparing the virtual potential temperature {\texttheta}v,th of the parcel with that of the surrounding environment {\texttheta}v,env at a given distance above instead of at the same level. This is consistent with the picture of detrained air parcels that experience some overshoot and reach a final destination at a level lower than the one at which they effectively leave the cloud or organized convective plume. The impacts of this modification are documented both for selected cases of stratocumulus, in comparison with large-eddy simulations, and in full 3-D climate simulations, in comparison with satellite observations of cloud cover. The modified scheme provides a uniform treatment of the dry convective boundary layer, of cumulus clouds, of stratocumulus, and of the transition from stratocumulus to cumulus. It is included in the most recent version of the LMDZ atmospheric general circulation model.},

  abstract = {We propose a new framework for parameterization of ocean convection processes. The new framework is termed ``patchy convection'' since our aim is to represent the heterogeneity of mixing processes that take place within the horizontal scope of a grid cell. We focus on applying this new scheme to represent the effect of pre-conditioning for deep convection by subgrid scale eddy variability. The new parameterization separates the grid-cell into two regions of different stratification, applies convective mixing separately to each region, and then recombines the density profile to produce the grid-cell mean density profile. The scheme depends on two parameters: the areal fraction of the vertically-mixed region within the horizontal grid cell, and the density difference between the mean and the unstratified profiles at the surface. We parameterize this density difference in terms of an unresolved eddy kinetic energy. We illustrate the patchy parameterization using a 1D idealized convection case before evaluating the scheme in two different global ocean-ice simulations with prescribed atmospheric forcing; (i) diagnosed eddy velocity field applied only in the Labrador Sea (ii) diagnosed global eddy velocity field. The global simulation results indicate that the patchy convection scheme improves the warm biases in the deep Atlantic Ocean and Southern Ocean. This proof-of-concept study is a first step in developing the patchy parameterization scheme, which will be extended in future to use a prognostic eddy field as well as to parameterize convection due to under-ice brine rejection.},

This quantity can be for instance the variance of an output variable. Three kinds of methods are distinguished: the screening (coarse sorting of the most influential inputs among a large number), the measures of importance (quantitative sensitivity indices) and the deep exploration of the model behaviour (measuring the effects of inputs on their all variation range). A progressive application methodology is illustrated on a scholar application. A synthesis is given to place every method according to several axes, mainly the cost in number of model evaluations, the model complexity and the nature of brought information.},

Recent research has highlighted that model biases in the mean climate state can affect the AMOC in its mean state, variability and its response to climate change. Hence, understanding and reducing these model biases is critical for reducing uncertainty in the future changes of the AMOC and in its impacts on the wider climate. We discuss how model biases, in particular salinity biases, influence the AMOC and deep convection. We then focus on biases in the UK HadGEM3-GC3-1 climate model and how these biases change with resolution. We also discuss ongoing model development activities that affect these biases, and highlight priorities for improved representation of processes, such as the position of the North Atlantic Current, transports in narrow boundary current, resolution (or improved parameterization) of eddies and spurious numerical mixing in overflows.

There is generally a good agreement, particularly in the recent conclusion from observations that the mean overturning in the east (particularly in the Iceland and Irminger seas) is stronger than that in the Labrador Sea. The overturning in the Labrador Sea is mostly found to be small, but has a strong relationship with salinity: fresh models have weak overturning and saline models have stronger mean overturning and stronger relationships of the Labrador Sea overturning variability with the AMOC further south.We also find that the overturning reconstructed from surface flux driven water mass transformation is a good indicator of the actual overturning, though mixing can modify variability and shift signals to different density classes.},

At the same time, the approach is simple and general enough to be readily implemented in ocean climate models, without adding significant computational cost.

These formulae quantify the decrease of effective buoyancy with increasing aspect ratio D/H, and show that this effect is more pronounced for surface cylinders, especially when D/H {$>$} 1. We gain intuition for these results by considering the pressure fields generated by these buoyant parcels, and we test our results with large-eddy simulations. Our formulae can inform parametrizations of the vertical velocity equation for clouds, and also provide a quantitative map of the `grey zone' in numerical modelling between hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic regimes.},

The sensitivities of precipitation and other related meteorological variables to 11 selected parameters in the new Kain-Fritsch Scheme, WRF Single-Moment 6-class Scheme, and Yonsei University Scheme are then investigated. The results demonstrate that (1) the Morris method is effective and efficient for screening important parameters qualitatively, and with recommended settings of levels p = 8 and replication times r = 10 only 10 {\texttimes} (D + 1) WRF runs are required, where D is the dimension of parameter space; (2) Gaussian process regression (GP) is the best method for constructing surrogates, and the GP-based Sobol' method can provide reliable quantitative results for sensitivity analysis when the number of WRF runs exceeds 200; and (3) the sensitivity index {$\mu\ast$} in the Morris method is closely related to the Sobol' index ST , and even for qualitative sensitivity analysis, the GP-based Sobol' method is more efficient compared to the Morris method. The SA results show that larger values of the downdraft-related parameter x1, entrainment-related parameter x2, and downdraft starting height x3 significantly decrease rainfall, while the maximum allowed value for the cloud ice diameter x6 has a moderate decreasing effect on precipitation. This work is useful for further tuning of the WRF to improve the agreement between the climate model and observations.},

However, it remains a puzzle where and through which route the near-inertial energy penetrates into the deep ocean. Using the measurements collected in the Kuroshio extension region during January 2005, we demonstrate that the diapycnal mixing in the thermocline and deep ocean is tightly related to the shear variance of wind-generated near-inertial internal waves with the diapycnal diffusivity 6 {\texttimes} 10-5\>m2s-1 almost an order stronger than that observed in the circulation gyre. It is estimated that 45\%--62\% of the local near-inertial wind work 4.5 {\texttimes} 10-3\>Wm-2 radiates into the thermocline and deep ocean and accounts for 42\%--58\% of the energy required to furnish mixing there. The elevated mixing is suggested to be maintained by the energetic near-inertial wind work and strong eddy activities causing enhanced downward near-inertial energy flux than earlier findings. The western boundary current turns out to be a key region for the penetration of near-inertial energy into the deep ocean and a hotspot for the diapycnal mixing in winter.},

Even with high-frequency coupling, CCSM4 underestimates the strength of NIWs, so that a parameterization for NIWs is developed and included into CCSM4. Numerous assumptions enter this parameterization, the core of which is that the NIW velocity signal is detected during the model integration, and amplified in the shear computation of the ocean surface boundary layer module. It is found that NIWs deepen the ocean mixed layer by up to 30\%, but they contribute little to the ventilation and mixing of the ocean below the thermocline. However, the deepening of the tropical mixed layer by NIWs leads to a change in tropical sea surface temperature and precipitation. Atmospheric teleconnections then change the global sea level pressure fields so that the midlatitude westerlies become weaker. Unfortunately, the magnitude of the real air-sea flux of NIW energy is poorly constrained by observations; this makes the quantitative assessment of their climate impact rather uncertain. Thus, a major result of the present study is that because of its importance for global climate the uncertainty in the observed tropical NIW energy has to be reduced.},

The present study tests some of the predictions from these simulations with field measurements from a summertime experiment in Sweden, which includes in addition to regular surface layer data also airborne measurements and numerous radio soundings, which enable accurate determination of boundary layer depth. It is found that the measurements strongly support most of the conclusions draws from the LES study and give additional information over a wider stability range. Thus, the normalized wind gradient {$\phi$}m is found to depend on both z/L, where z is height above the ground and L is the Monin--Obukhov length, and zi/L, where zi is the height of the convective boundary layer. This additional dependence on zi/L explains much of the scatter between experiments encountered for this parameter. In the case of the normalized temperature gradient {$\phi$}h, the experimental data follow the generally accepted functional relation with z/L, but with an additional, slight ordering according to zi/L. Analyses of nondimensional variances show (i) the horizontal velocity variance scales on mixed layer variables and is a function only of zi/L, in agreement with the LES results and with previous measurements; (ii) the normalized vertical velocity variance depends on the large-scale pressure gradient length scale for slight instability and is primarily a function of z/L for moderate and strong instability; (iii) the normalized temperature variance is a function of z/L, with a possible slight dependence on zi/L; and (iv) whereas mean temperature gradient is characterized by local shear scales, temperature variances are normalized by local buoyancy-driven scales.},

  abstract = {Abstract The intensity and scale of the geostrophically adjusted end state of the convective overturning of a homogeneous rotating ocean of depth H at a latitude where the Coriolis parameter is f, induced by surface buoyancy loss of magnitude B0, are studied by numerical experiment. The experiments are related to observations and laboratory studies of open-ocean deep convection. A numerical model based on the nonhydrostatic Boussinesq equations is used. The grid spacing of the model is small enough that gross aspects of convective plumes themselves can be resolved, yet the domain of integration is sufficiently large to permit study of the influence of plumes on the large scale and geostrophic adjustment of the convected water. Numerical simulations suggest that cooling at the sea surface is offset by buoyancy drawn from depth through the agency of convective plumes. These plumes efficiently mix the water column to generate a dense chimney of fluid, which subsequently breaks up through the mechanism of baroclinic instability to form spinning cones of convectively modified water that have a well-defined and predictable scale. A measure of the importance of rotation on the convective process is provided by a natural Rossby number introduced by Maxworthy and Narimousa: where lrot = (B0/f3)1/2 is the length scale that marks the transition from three-dimensional, thermally driven turbulence to quasi-two-dimensional, rotationally dominated motions. Here urot=(B0/f)1/2 is the velocity of a particle gyrating in inertia] circles of radius lrot. In the parameter regime typical of open-ocean deep convection, we find that Ro* {$\lessequivlnt$} 1; rotation influences the intensity and scale of both plumes and cones. In particular, the scale, intensity, buoyancy excess, and generation rate of the cones of geostrophically adjusted fluid, which result from the breakup of the chimney, are found to depend in a predictable way on this single nondimensional number, formed from the external parameters f, B0, and H.},

Of particular interest is the interface between the convective layer and the stable stratification, where the entrainment of fluid into the convective layer by penetrating plumes may lead to a reverse buoyancy flux, and an enhancement of the stable stratification. Whereas in the atmosphere the influence of rotation on this penetrative convection is negligible, oceanic convection may be subjected to lower Rossby numbers and hence greater rotational influence. To isolate the effects of rotation, we present three numerical solutions for turbulent penetrative convection, characterised by different rotation rates, with all other parameters being held constant. Our results indicate that at lower Rossby numbers the lateral scale of the plumes is reduced, whereas the vertical vorticity of the plumes is much enhanced. Vertical transports of buoyancy and kinetic energy across the convective layer are reduced, leading to less efficient penetration at the interface with the stratified layer, and hence less reverse buoyancy flux in this region.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric and oceanic convection often occurs over areas occupied by many  localized circulation elements known as               plumes               . The convective transports therefore  may depend not only on the individual elements, but also on the interactions between  plumes and the turbulent environment created by other plumes. However, many  attempts to understand these plumes focus on individual isolated elements, and  the behaviour of an ensemble is not understood. Geophysical convection may be  influenced by rotation when the transit time of a convecting element is long compared  to an inertial period (for example in deep oceanic convection). Much recent attention  has been given to the effect of rotation on individual plumes, but the role of rotation  in modifying the behaviour of an ensemble is not fully understood. Here we examine  the behaviour of plumes within an ensemble, both with and without rotation, to  identify the influence of rotation on ensemble plume dynamics.                          We identify the coherent structures (plumes) present in numerical solutions of  turbulent Rayleigh--B{\'e}nard convection, a canonical example of a turbulent plume  ensemble. We use a conditional sampling compositing technique to extract the typical  structure in both non-rotating and rotating solutions. The dynamical balances of  these composite plumes are evaluated and compared with entraining plume models.  We find many differences between non-rotating and rotating plumes in their transports  of mass, buoyancy and momentum. As shown in previous studies, the expansion  of the turbulent plume by entrainment of exterior fluid is suppressed by strong rotation.  Our most significant new result is quantification of the continuous mixing  between the plume and ambient fluid which occurs at high rotation without any  net changes in plume volume. This mixing is generated by the plume--plume interactions  and acts to reduce the buoyancy anomaly of the plume. By contrast, in the  non-rotating case, no such loss of buoyancy by mixing occurs. As a result, the total  buoyancy transport by upwardly moving plumes diminishes across the layer in the  rotating case, while remaining approximately constant in the non-rotating case. At  high values of rotation, the net vertical acceleration is considerably reduced compared  to the non-rotating case due to loss of momentum through entrainment and mixing  and a decelerating pressure gradient which partially balances the buoyancy-driven  acceleration of plumes. As a result of the dilution of buoyancy, the pressure-gradient  deceleration and the loss of momentum due to mixing with the environment in the  rotating solutions, the conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy is significantly  less than that of non-rotating plumes.             The combination of efficient lateral mixing and slow vertical movement by the  plumes accounts for the unstable mean temperature gradient that occurs in rotating  Rayleigh--B{\'e}nard convection, while the less penetrative convection found at low  Rossby number is a consequence of the reduced kinetic energy transport. Within the  ensemble of plumes identified by the conditional sampling algorithm, distributions  of vertical velocity, buoyancy and vorticity mimic those of the volume as a whole.  Plumes cover a small fraction of the total area, yet account for most of the vertical  heat flux.},

  abstract = {A study of the dynamical formation mechanisms of atmospheric boundary-layer vortices is being conducted. These vortices are typically manifest as dust devils although there is evidence that they exist with some frequency in the absence of visible flow tracers. For example, in 1997 MacPherson and Belts pointed out instrument observations of invisible boundary-layer vertical vortices over the boreal forest. Several possible mechanisms for vortex formation under a variety of different dynamical regimes are described. Most observational investigators have reported that dust devils form in environments characterized by low wind speeds. The most intriguing unknown is the source of vorticity for the formation of vortices for convection in the absence (or near absence) of mean winds. Vertical vortex formation in convection without a mean shear has not often been documented in laboratory or numerical simulations. A Large-Eddy Simulation of the convective boundary layer is performed, without mean winds, with the purpose of examining vertical vortex-format ion mechanisms. The current work emphasizes the conjectured larger (convective) scale vorticity-generating mechanisms. The results indicate that vertical vortices form at some, but not all of the vertices of the simulated pattern of open convective cells. The columnar vortices may be essentially vertical or tilt with height, and may or may not extend to the surface. It is suggested that the vertical vorticity initially available to the vortices comes from the tilting of horizontal vorticity associated with local unidirectional shears due to the convective-cell circulations, with convective-cell asymmetries being important to the process. Subsequent evolution apparently results in the co-location of vertical vorticity centres with local updraught maxima.},

A large corpus of data and numerical simulations agree on a near-universal relation between Prt and the Richardson number (Ri), which encodes the relative importance of buoyancy dissipation to mechanical production of turbulent kinetic energy. The Prt--Ri relation is shown to be derivable solely from the cospectral budgets for momentum and heat fluxes if a Rotta-like return to isotropy closure for the pressure-strain effects and Kolmogorov's theory for turbulent cascade are invoked. The ratio of the Kolmogorov to the Kolmogorov-Obukhov-Corrsin phenomenological constants, and a constant associated with isotropization of the production whose value (=3/5) has been predicted from Rapid Distortion Theory, explain all the macroscopic nonlinearities.},

Stability of their solutions can be studied by examining sectional curvature of these groups: negative curvature in all sections implies exponential growth of perturbations and hence suggests instability, while positive curvature suggests stability. In the first part of the paper we survey what we currently know about the curvature-stability relation in this context and provide detailed calculations for several equations of continuum mechanics associated to Sobolev H0 and H1 energies. In the second part we prove that in most cases (with some notable exceptions) the sectional curvature assumes both signs.},

  abstract = {The ocean is a turbulent fluid with processes acting on a variety of spatio-temporal scales. The estimates of energy fluxes between length scales allows us to understand how the mean flow is maintained as well as how mesoscale eddies are formed and dissipated. Here, we quantify the kinetic energy budget in a suite of realistic global ocean models, with varying horizontal resolution and horizontal viscosity. We show that eddy-permitting ocean models have weaker kinetic energy cascades than eddy-resolving models due to discrepancies in the effect of wind forcing, horizontal viscosity, potential to kinetic energy conversion, and nonlinear interactions on the kinetic energy (KE) budget. However, the change in eddy kinetic energy between the eddy-permitting and the eddy-resolving model is not enough to noticeably change the scale where the inverse cascade arrests or the Rhines scale. In addition, we show that the mechanism by which baroclinic flows organise into barotropic flows is weaker at lower resolution, resulting in a more baroclinic flow. Hence, the horizontal resolution impacts the vertical structure of the simulated flow. Our results suggest that the effect of mesoscale eddies can be parameterised by enhancing the potential to kinetic energy conversion, i.e., the horizontal pressure gradients, or enhancing the inverse cascade of kinetic energy.},

The representation of convection varies strongly among models. Compared to observations from ARGO-floats and the EN4 data set, most models substantially overestimate deep convection in the Labrador Sea. In four out of five models, all four using the NEMO-ocean model, increasing the ocean resolution from 1{$^\circ$} to 1/4{$^\circ$} leads to increased deep mixing in the Labrador Sea. Increasing the atmospheric resolution has a smaller effect than increasing the ocean resolution. Simulated convection in the Labrador Sea is mainly governed by the release of heat from the ocean to the atmosphere and by the vertical stratification of the water masses in the Labrador Sea in late autumn. Models with stronger sub-polar gyre circulation have generally higher surface salinity in the Labrador Sea and a deeper convection. While the high-resolution models show more realistic ocean stratification in the Labrador Sea than the standard resolution models, they generally overestimate the convection. The results indicate that the representation of sub-grid scale mixing processes might be imperfect in the models and contribute to the biases in deep convection. Since in more than half of the models, the Labrador Sea convection is important for the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), this raises questions about the future behavior of the AMOC in the models.},

  abstract = {Real-time reconstruction of ocean surface currents is a challenge due to the complex, non-linear dynamics of the ocean, the small number of in situ measurements, and the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of satellite altimetry observations. To address this challenge, we introduce HIRES-CURRENTS-Net, an operational real-time convolutional neural network (CNN) model for daily ocean current reconstruction. This study focuses on the Mediterranean Sea, a region where operational models have great difficulty predicting surface currents. Notably, our model showcases higher accuracy compared to commonly used alternative methods. HIRES-CURRENTS-Net integrates high-resolution measurements from the infrared or visible spectrum---high resolution Sea Surface Temperature (SST) or chlorophyll (CHL) images---in addition to the low-resolution Sea Surface Height (SSH) maps derived from satellite altimeters. In the first stage, we apply a transfer learning method which uses a high-resolution numerical model to pre-train our CNN model on simulated SSH and SST data with synthetic clouds. The observation of System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) offers us a sufficient training dataset with reference surface currents at very high resolution, and a model trained on this data can then be applied to real data. In the second stage, to enhance the real-time operational performance of our model over previous methods, we fine-tune the CNN model on real satellite data using a novel pseudo-labeling strategy. We validate HIRES-CURRENTS-Net on real data from drifters and demonstrate that our data-driven approach proves effective for real-time sea surface current reconstruction with potential operational applications such as ship routing.},

This occurs for both mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) and less-organized convection, raising the question: is there a simple, universal characteristic governing the deep inflow? Here, we argue that nonlocal dynamics of the response to buoyancy are key. For precipitating deep-convective features including horizontal scales comparable to a substantial fraction of the troposphere depth, the response to buoyancy tends to yield deep inflow into the updraft mass flux. Precipitation features in this range of scales are found to dominate contributions to observed convective precipitation for both MCS and less-organized convection. The importance of such nonlocal dynamics implies thinking beyond parcel models with small-scale turbulence for representation of convection in climate models. Solutions here lend support to investment in parameterizations at a complexity between conventional and superparameterization.},

The model includes state-of-the-art physics parameterization schemes that are important to represent convective-scale phenomena and turbulent eddies, as well as flows at larger scales.

The grey zone of shallow convection is found between the horizontal resolutions of mesoscale numerical models (2--3 km) and large-eddy simulations (10--100~m or finer). At these horizontal scales the shallow convection is to some extent explicitly resolved by the model. The shallow-convection parametrization is still needed, but has to be regulated according to the model horizontal resolution. Here the behaviour of the non-hydrostatic mesoscale numerical weather prediction model Application of Research to Operations at Mesoscale is examined in the grey zone and a new scale-adaptive surface closure of its shallow-convection parametrization, dependent on horizontal resolution, is defined based on large-eddy simulation. The new closure is tested on a series of numerical experiments and validated on a 15-day-long real case period. Its impact on the development of deep convection is examined in detail. The idealized simulations show promising results, as the mean profiles of the subgrid and resolved turbulence change in the desired way. Based on the real case tests our modification has a low impact on model performance, but is part of a set of upgrades of the current parametrization that is aimed to treat the shallow convection grey zone.},

Ideal for a two-semester graduate course, the book includes a variety of problems, carefully chosen to familiarize the student with new concepts and to illuminate the general principles involved. Moreover, it offers excellent grounding for the student of mathematics, engineering, or physics who does not intend to specialize in mechanics, but wants a thorough grasp of the underlying principles. The late Professor Lanczos (Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies) was a well-known physicist and educator who brought a superb pedagogical sense and profound grasp of the principles of mechanics to this work, now available for the first time in an inexpensive Dover paperback edition.

  abstract = {If model parameterizations of unresolved physics, such as the variety of upper ocean mixing processes, are to hold over the large range of time and space scales of importance to climate, they must be strongly physically based. Observations, theories, and models of oceanic vertical mixing are surveyed. Two distinct regimes are identified: ocean mixing in the boundary layer near the surface under a variety of surface forcing conditions (stabilizing, destabilizing, and wind driven), and mixing in the ocean interior due to internal waves, shear instability, and double diffusion (arising from the different molecular diffusion rates of heat and salt). Mixing schemes commonly applied to the upper ocean are shown not to contain some potentially important boundary layer physics. Therefore a new parameterization of oceanic boundary layer mixing is developed to accommodate some of this physics. It includes a scheme for determining the boundary layer depth h, where the turbulent contribution to the vertical shear of a bulk Richardson number is parameterized. Expressions for diffusivity and nonlocal transport throughout the boundary layer are given. The diffusivity is formulated to agree with similarity theory of turbulence in the surface layer and is subject to the conditions that both it and its vertical gradient match the interior values at h. This nonlocal ``K profile parameterization'' (KPP) is then verified and compared to alternatives, including its atmospheric counterparts. Its most important feature is shown to be the capability of the boundary layer to penetrate well into a stable thermocline in both convective and wind-driven situations. The diffusivities of the aforementioned three interior mixing processes are modeled as constants, functions of a gradient Richardson number (a measure of the relative importance of stratification to destabilizing shear), and functions of the double-diffusion density ratio, R{$\rho$}. Oceanic simulations of convective penetration, wind deepening, and diurnal cycling are used to determine appropriate values for various model parameters as weak functions of vertical resolution. Annual cycle simulations at ocean weather station Papa for 1961 and 1969--1974 are used to test the complete suite of parameterizations. Model and observed temperatures at all depths are shown to agree very well into September, after which systematic advective cooling in the ocean produces expected differences. It is argued that this cooling and a steady salt advection into the model are needed to balance the net annual surface heating and freshwater input. With these advections, good multiyear simulations of temperature and salinity can be achieved. These results and KPP simulations of the diurnal cycle at the Long-Term Upper Ocean Study (LOTUS) site are compared with the results of other models. It is demonstrated that the KPP model exchanges properties between the mixed layer and thermocline in a manner consistent with observations, and at least as well or better than alternatives.},

The processes that govern its lifecycle are therefore key to the ocean's carbon and heat storage capacity on centennial to multi-millennial timescales. This thesis aims at characterizing and quantifying processes responsible for the destruction (synonymous of lightening and upwelling) of Antarctic Bottom Water in the abyssal ocean. Using an observational estimate of the global ocean thermohaline structure and diagnostics based on the density budget of deep waters, we explore the roles of basin geometry, geothermal heating and mixing by breaking internal waves for the abyssal circulation. We show that the shape of ocean basins largely controls the structure of abyssal upwelling. The contribution of mixing powered by breaking internal waves, though poorly constrained, is estimated to be insufficient to destroy Antarctic Bottom Water at a rate comparable to that of its formation. Geothermal heating plays an important role for the upwelling of waters covering large seafloor areas. The results suggest a reappraisal of the role of mixing in deep straits and sills, but also of the fundamental role of basin geometry, for the lightening and transport of abyssal waters.},

  abstract = {Vertical mixing is often regarded as the Achilles' heel of ocean models. In particular, few models include a comprehensive and energy-constrained parameterization of mixing by internal ocean tides. Here, we present an energy-conserving mixing scheme which accounts for the local breaking of high-mode internal tides and the distant dissipation of low-mode internal tides. The scheme relies on four static two-dimensional maps of internal tide dissipation, constructed using mode-by-mode Lagrangian tracking of energy beams from sources to sinks. Each map is associated with a distinct dissipative process and a corresponding vertical structure. Applied to an observational climatology of stratification, the scheme produces a global three-dimensional map of dissipation which compares well with available microstructure observations and with upper-ocean finestructure mixing estimates. This relative agreement, both in magnitude and spatial structure across ocean basins, suggests that internal tides underpin most of observed dissipation in the ocean interior at the global scale. The proposed parameterization is therefore expected to improve understanding, mapping, and modeling of ocean mixing.},

  abstract = {Abstract Deep winter convection in the northwestern Mediterranean (Gulf of Lions) and the subsequent formation of Mediterranean Deep Water were observed using advanced oceanographic instrumentation during a six-week long experiment in 1987. The severe 1987 European winter forced an intense outbreak of the Mistral, a cold, dry wind blowing down the Rhone valley, in mid-January. Surface cooling and evaporation were of sufficient intensity to cause an initial episode of deep convection shortly before the experiment described here began. However, several more Mistral events took place during the experiment. During several cruises into the area, CTD and absolute horizontal velocity profiles were measured in the mixed area over the Rhone fan as well as across the southern front of this region; in addition, continuous records of shipboard meteorological and oceanographic parameters (air temperature, surface salinity, etc.) were made. An early-February Mistral apparently did not produce enough surface cooling to reinitiate convection. In contrast, further convection during an intense, mid-February Mistral was observed in both hydrographic and current-meter data. The 0.02{$^\circ$}C cooling observed in CTD data at 1950 m, as well as in data from moored temperature sensors at other depths by the end of this storm, is consistent with what would be expected if the estimated surface heat loss were mixed over the 2200 m depth of the water column. Analysis of CTD data shows that the presence of unstably stratified surface layers was correlated with periods of strong surface cooling. An inverse relation appears to exist between the thickness and density excess of these layers. Comparison with surface cooling rates suggests that these layers could be formed in periods as short as one hour. Finally, comparison of our results to historical data suggests that deep water formed in the northwestern Mediterranean has become progressively warmer and saltier over the past several decades.},

  abstract = {The representation of turbulent fluxes during oceanic convective events is important to capture the evolution of the oceanic mixed layer. To improve the accuracy of turbulent fluxes, we examine the possibility of adding a non-gradient component in their expression in addition to the usual downgradient part. To do so, we extend the \$k-{\textbackslash}varepsilon\$ algebraic second-moment closure by relaxing the assumption on the equilibrium of the temperature variance \${\textbackslash}overline\{{\textbackslash}theta'{\textasciicircum}2\}\$. With this additional transport equation for the temperature variance, we obtain a \$k - {\textbackslash}varepsilon - {\textbackslash}overline\{{\textbackslash}theta'{\textasciicircum}2\}\$ model (the ``\$k {\textbackslash}varepsilon t\$'' model) which includes a non-gradient term for the temperature flux. We validate this new model against Large Eddy Simulations (LES) in both wind-forced and buoyancy-driven regimes. In both cases, we find that the vertical profile of temperature is well captured by the \$k {\textbackslash}varepsilon t\$ model. Particularly, for the buoyancy-driven regime, the non-gradient term increases the portion of the mixed layer that is stably stratified. This is an improvement since this portion is too small with the \$k - {\textbackslash}varepsilon\$ parameterization. Finally, a comparison of the non-gradient term with the KPP non-local term gives insights for refining the KPP's ad hoc shape polynomial.},

We propose here a generic framework to evaluate the mixed layer depth (MLD) dynamics across a wide range of forcings and preconditioning conditions. To do so, we propose to use a physically-based parameter space formed by two dimensionless numbers: \${\textbackslash}lambda\_s\$ the relative contribution of the buoyancy flux and the wind in the surface layer, and the Richardson number \$R\_h\$ which characterizes the stability of the water column at the mixed layer base. Four MLD dynamics regimes (``restratification'', ``stable'', ``deepening'' and ``strong deepening'') are defined based on the values of the normalized temporal evolution of the MLD. We show the robustness and the predictive skill of the parameter space in a context of 1D simulations by showing that to a given (\${\textbackslash}lambda\_s\$, \$R\_h\$) corresponds a predictable MLD dynamics regime. Finally, we present two applications showing how the parameter space can be used with 3D ocean realistic models. We discuss the impact of the horizontal resolution (1{$^\circ$}, 1/12{$^\circ$} or 1/60{$^\circ$}) and the Gent McWilliams parameterization on the MLD dynamics regimes.},

  abstract = {Abstract Observations of open-ocean deep convection indicate that it is a highly localized phenomenon, occurring over areas of tens of kilometers in diameter. The cause of this localization has been ascribed to ``preconditioning''---the local weakening of the stable density stratification associated with upwardly domed isopycnal surfaces in a surface-intensified cyclonic circulation. However, most numerical and laboratory studies of localized convection have prescribed the localization artificially, by confining the surface buoyancy loss to a circular disk. In contrast, in the numerical simulations described here, deep convection forced by horizontally uniform buoyancy loss is localized within a region of initially weaker stratification than its surroundings. The preconditioned region is associated with a cold-core cyclonic eddy in geostrophic and cyclostrophic balance. As in previous studies of disk-shaped cooling, the localized convection region undergoes baroclinic instability at late times, causing the breakup of the convection region into multiple eddies. However, since the stratification structure determines the extent of vertical buoyancy fluxes, the region of deepest heat loss migrates with the eddy structures. Furthermore, the localized convection generates a secondary circulation in the plane perpendicular to the original eddy circulation. This circulation initiates the restratification of the eddy core even before the onset of baroclinic instability. Eventually the original preconditioned eddy is destroyed by the baroclinic eddy fluxes. The net effect of the eddy on the mean temperature field is to ensure a warmer upper layer and colder pycnocline than would be achieved with horizontally uniform convection. The authors investigate the dependence of this flow evolution on the size and strength of the preconditioned eddy.},

An estimate of the entrainment buoyancy flux scaling is made to best fit the LES results. The presence of Stokes drift forcing and the resulting Langmuir turbulence enhances the entrainment rate significantly under weak surface destabilizing buoyancy flux conditions, that is, weakly convective turbulence. In contrast, Langmuir turbulence effects are moderate when convective turbulence is dominant and appear to be additive rather than multiplicative to the convection-induced mixing. The parameterized unresolved velocity scale in the K-profile parameterization (KPP) is modified to adhere to the new scaling law of the entrainment buoyancy flux and account for the effects of Langmuir turbulence. This modification is targeted on common situations in a climate model where either Langmuir turbulence or convection is important and may overestimate the entrainment when both are weak. Nevertheless, the modified KPP is tested in a global climate model and generally outperforms those tested in previous studies.

Traditional non-Langmuir schemes systematically underpredict large eddy simulation vertical mixing under weak convective forcing, while Langmuir schemes vary in accuracy. Under global, realistic forcing Langmuir schemes produce 6\% (-1\% to 14\% for 90\% confidence) or 5.2 m (-0.2 m to 17.4 m for 90\% confidence) deeper monthly mean mixed layer depths than their non-Langmuir counterparts, with the greatest differences in extratropical regions, especially the Southern Ocean in austral summer.

Non-Langmuir schemes disagree with each other to a lesser extent, with a similar ordering.

This is also one of the main assumptions of Monin--Obukhov similarity theory (MOST). However, previous evidence seems to indicate that outer-scale eddies can impact the ASL, resulting in deviations from the classic MOST scaling. We conduct large-eddy simulations and direct numerical simulations of a dry convective boundary layer to investigate the impact of coherent structures on the ASL. A height-dependent passive tracer enables coherent structure detection and conditional analysis based on updrafts and subsidence. The MOST similarity functions computed from the simulation results indicate a larger deviation of the momentum similarity function {$<$}em{$>\phi<$}/em{$>$}\textsubscript{{$<$}em{$>$}m{$<$}/em{$>$}} from classical scaling relationships compared to the temperature similarity function {$<$}em{$>\phi<$}/em{$>$}\textsubscript{{$<$}em{$>$}h{$<$}/em{$>$}}. The conditional-averaged {$<$}em{$>\phi<$}/em{$>$}\textsubscript{{$<$}em{$>$}m{$<$}/em{$>$}} for updrafts and subsidence are similar, indicating strong interactions between the inner and outer layers. However, {$<$}em{$>\phi<$}/em{$>$}\textsubscript{{$<$}em{$>$}h{$<$}/em{$>$}} conditioned on subsidence follows the mixed-layer scaling, while its updraft counterpart is well predicted by MOST. Updrafts are the dominant contributors to the transport of momentum and temperature. Subsidence, which comprises eddies that originate from the outer layer, contributes increasingly to the transport of temperature with increasing instability. However, {$<$}em{$>$}u{$<$}/em{$>\prime$} of different signs are distributed symmetrically in subsidence unlike the predominantly negative {$<$}em{$>\theta<$}/em{$>\prime$} as instability increases. Thus, the spatial patterns of {$<$}em{$>$}u{$<$}/em{$>\prime<$}em{$>$}w{$<$}/em{$>\prime$} differ compared to {$<$}em{$>\theta<$}/em{$>\prime<$}em{$>$}w{$<$}/em{$>\prime$} in regions of subsidence.

  abstract = {An important feature of the planetary oceanic dynamics is that the aspect ratio (the ratio of the depth to horizontal width) is very small. As a result, the hydrostatic approximation (balance), derived by performing the formal small aspect ratio limit to the Navier--Stokes equations, is considered as a fundamental component in the primitive equations of the large-scale ocean. In this paper, we justify rigorously the small aspect ratio limit of the Navier--Stokes equations to the primitive equations. Specifically, we prove that the Navier--Stokes equations, after being scaled appropriately by the small aspect ratio parameter of the physical domain, converge strongly to the primitive equations, globally and uniformly in time, and the convergence rate is of the same order as the aspect ratio parameter. This result validates the hydrostatic approximation for the large-scale oceanic dynamics. Notably, only the weak convergence of this small aspect ratio limit was rigorously justified before. R{\'e}sum{\'e} Un point important dans la dynamique plan{\'e}taire oc{\'e}anique est le fait que le param{\`e}tre d'aspect (rapport entre la profondeur et la dimension horizontale) est tr{\`e}s petit. En cons{\'e}quence, l'approximation hydrostatique, obtenue en prenant une limite formelle, lorsque le param{\`e}tre d'aspect tend vers z{\'e}ro, dans les {\'e}quations de Navier--Stokes, est consid{\'e}r{\'e}e comme une {\'e}tape fondamentale dans la d{\'e}rivation des {\'e}quations primitives pour un oc{\'e}an {\`a} grande {\'e}chelle. Dans cet article, nous justifions rigoureusement les {\'e}quations primitives comme limite des {\'e}quations de Navier--Stokes, lorsque le param{\`e}tre d'aspect tend vers z{\'e}ro.

  abstract = {Cospectral budgets are used to link the kinetic and potential energy distributions of turbulent eddies, as measured by their spectra, to macroscopic relations between the turbulent Prandtl number (Prt) and atmospheric stability measures such as the stability parameter z, the gradient Richardson number Rg, or the flux Richardson number Rf in the atmospheric surface layer. The dependence of Prt on z, Rg, or Rf is shown to be primarily controlled by the ratio of Kolmogorov and Kolmogorov--Obukhov--Corrsin phenomenological constants and a constant associated with isotropization of turbulent flux production that can be independently determined using rapid distortion theory in homogeneous turbulence. Changes in scaling laws of the vertical velocity and air temperature spectra are also shown to affect the Prt--z (or Prt--Rg or Prt--Rf) relation. Results suggest that departure of Prt from unity under neutral conditions is induced by dissimilarity between momentum and heat in terms of Rotta constants, isotropization constants, and constants in the flux transfer terms. A maximum flux Richardson number Rfm predicted from the cospectral budgets method (50.25) is in good agreement with values in the literature, suggesting that Rfm may be tied to the collapse of Kolmogorov spectra instead of laminarization of turbulent flows under stable stratification. The linkages between microscale energy distributions of turbulent eddies and macroscopic relations that are principally determined by dimensional considerations or similarity theories suggest that when these scalewise energy distributions of eddies experience a ``transition'' to other distributions (e.g., when Rf is increased over Rfm), dimensional considerations or similarity theories may fail to predict bulk flow properties.},

In this study, the SGS Prandtl number is revisited by solving the co-spectral budgets of momentum and heat fluxes in an idealized but thermally stratified atmospheric surface layer. The SGS Prandtl number from the co-spectral budget model shows a strong dependence on the atmospheric stability and increases (decreases) as the atmosphere becomes stable (unstable), which is in good agreement with recent field experimental data. The dependence of                                                                                                                {$Pr$}PrPr                                                               on the filter scale is also captured by the co-spectral budget model: as the filter scale becomes smaller, the SGS Prandtl number decreases. Finally, the value of SGS Prandtl number under neutral conditions is shown to be caused by the dissimilarity between momentum and heat in the pressure decorrelation term and the flux transfer term. When the dissimilarity exists only in the flux transfer term, the fact that under neutral conditions the SGS Prandtl number is usually smaller than the turbulent Prandtl number for Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes simulations is an indication of a stronger spectral transfer coefficient for heat than for momentum. The model proposed in this study can be readily implemented.},

  abstract = {First-order turbulence closure schemes continue to be work-horse models for weather and climate simulations. The turbulent Prandtl number, which represents the dissimilarity between turbulent transport of momentum and heat, is a key parameter in such schemes. This paper reviews recent advances in our understanding and modeling of the turbulent Prandtl number in high-Reynolds number and thermally stratified atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) flows. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that there are strong linkages between the mean flow properties such as the turbulent Prandtl number in the atmospheric surface layer (ASL) and the energy spectra in the inertial subrange governed by the Kolmogorov theory. Such linkages are formalized by a recently developed cospectral budget model, which provides a unifying framework for the turbulent Prandtl number in the ASL. The model demonstrates that the stability-dependence of the turbulent Prandtl number can be essentially captured with only two phenomenological constants. The model further explains the stability- and scale-dependences of the subgrid-scale Prandtl number in large-eddy simulation. The connections between mean flow properties and microscale energy distributions shed novel insights into the breakdown of Monin-Obukhov similarity theory under strongly stable conditions.},

The geometric representation of the CBL as a pair of two-dimensional cubical complexes, one each for updrafts and downdrafts, is exemplarily obtained from two simulations of the CBL, a realistic daily cycle and an idealized quasi-steady CBL growing into linear stratification. Each cubical complex is defined as a set of grid cells that have the same sign of vertical velocity, either positive or negative. Low-order topological invariants, namely the Betti numbers of the cubical complexes, are found to capture key aspects of the boundary-layer organization and evolution over the diurnal cycle. An unsupervised-learning algorithm is trained using the topological invariants in order to classify the spatio--temporal evolution of convection over a whole day. The successful classification of the CBL by using this approach illustrates the potential of such simplified representation of turbulent flow for data reduction and boundarylayer parametrization approaches.},

  abstract = {Theoretical models are constructed with the aim of relating, explaining and predicting features of a radiatively active turbulent cloud layer over the sea and under a strong subsidence inversion. Both dry aerosol clouds (no phase change) and wet clouds (with a phase change and latent heat exchanges) are considered. For the wet cloud case an important element of the theory is the requirement that the wet-bulb potential temperature must increase upwards in the inversion. For both cases entrainment of the upper warm air is hypothesized to lie between upper and lower limits determined from the turbulent energy budget. The dry cloud case is solved for both steady state and transient results, with only the transient behaviour depending on the entrainment hypothesis. Only steady state solutions are presented for the more complex wet cloud case and these differ somewhat for the maximum and minimum entrainment limits. Observational data from Oakland, California are used for comparison with those steady state solutions, with results indicating the essential validity of the approach. Detailed comparisons, especially for determination of the most correct entrainment rate, are hampered both by inadequate measurement of the inversion properties and by uncertainties in the net radiation flux leaving the cloud top. Computations of the latter suggest that several presently used radiation models are still in serious disagreement, at least for application to downward flux under an inversion. It is suggested that the present theory provides a partial explanation of the origin of the trade wind inversion.},

  abstract = {Because of their limited spatial resolution, numerical weather prediction and climate models have to rely on parameterizations to represent atmospheric turbulence and convection. Historically, largely independent approaches have been used to represent boundary layer turbulence and convection, neglecting important interactions at the subgrid scale. Here we build on an eddy-diffusivity mass-flux (EDMF) scheme that represents all subgrid-scale mixing in a unified manner, partitioning subgrid-scale fluctuations into contributions from local diffusive mixing and coherent advective structures and allowing them to interact within a single framework. The EDMF scheme requires closures for the interaction between the turbulent environment and the plumes and for local mixing. A second-order equation for turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) provides one ingredient for the diffusive local mixing closure, leaving a mixing length to be parameterized. Here, we propose a new mixing length formulation, based on constraints derived from the TKE balance. It expresses local mixing in terms of the same physical processes in all regimes of boundary layer flow. The formulation is tested at a range of resolutions and across a wide range of boundary layer regimes, including a stably stratified boundary layer, a stratocumulus-topped marine boundary layer, and dry convection. Comparison with large eddy simulations (LES) shows that the EDMF scheme with this diffusive mixing parameterization accurately captures the structure of the boundary layer and clouds in all cases considered.},

  abstract = {Most machine learning applications in Earth system modeling currently rely on gradient-based supervised learning. This imposes stringent constraints on the nature of the data used for training (typically, residual time tendencies are needed), and it complicates learning about the interactions between machine-learned parameterizations and other components of an Earth system model. Approaching learning about process-based parameterizations as an inverse problem resolves many of these issues, since it allows parameterizations to be trained with partial observations or statistics that directly relate to quantities of interest in long-term climate projections. Here, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Kalman inversion methods in treating learning about parameterizations as an inverse problem. We consider two different algorithms: unscented and ensemble Kalman inversion. Both methods involve highly parallelizable forward model evaluations, converge exponentially fast, and do not require gradient computations. In addition, unscented Kalman inversion provides a measure of parameter uncertainty. We illustrate how training parameterizations can be posed as a regularized inverse problem and solved by ensemble Kalman methods through the calibration of an eddy-diffusivity mass-flux scheme for subgrid-scale turbulence and convection, using data generated by large-eddy simulations. We find the algorithms amenable to batching strategies, robust to noise and model failures, and efficient in the calibration of hybrid parameterizations that can include empirical closures and neural networks.},

However, MOR of hyperbolic equations remains a challenge. Symmetries and conservation laws, which are a distinctive feature of such systems, are often destroyed by conventional MOR techniques, resulting in a perturbed and often unstable reduced system. The goal of this thesis is to study and develop model order reduction techniques that can preserve nonlinear invariants, symmetries, and conservation laws and to understand the stability properties of these methods compared to conventional techniques. Hamiltonian systems, as systems that are driven by symmetries, are studied intensively from the point of view of MOR. Furthermore, a conservative model reduction of fluid flow is presented. It is illustrated that conserving invariants, conservation laws, and symmetries not only result in a physically meaningful reduced system but also result in an accurate and robust reduced system with enhanced stability.},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper it to derive general coordinate-invariant forms of the Eliassen--Palm flux tensor and thereby characterize the true geometric nature of the eddy--mean-flow interaction in hydrostatic Boussinesq rotating fluids. In the quasi-geostrophic limit previous forms of the Eliassen--Palm flux tensor are shown to be related to each other via a gauge transformation; a general form is stated and its geometric properties are discussed. Similar methodology is applied to the hydrostatic Boussinesq Navier--Stokes equations to re-derive the residual-mean equations in a coordinate-invariant form. Thickness-weighted averaging in buoyancy coordinates is carefully described, via the definition of a volume-form-weighted average, constructed so as to commute with the covariant divergence of a vector. The procedures leading to the thickness-weight averaged equation are discussed, and forms of the Eliassen--Palm flux tensor which arise are identified.},

  abstract = {Abstract Deep-water formation (DWF) in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea and the subsequent horizontal circulation are investigated in a rectangular basin with a three-dimensional primitive equation model. The basin is forced by constant climatological heat and salt fluxes. Convective motion is parameterized by a simple nonpenetrative convective adjustment process plus Richardson number--dependent vertical eddy viscosity and diffusivity. A homogeneous column of dense water is progressively formed in the forcing area. Meanders of 40-km wavelength develop at the periphery of the column. These features agree with observations. Energy studies show that the meanders are generated mainly through a baroclinic instability process. These meanders, and the associated cells of vertical motion, contribute to the process of DWF. They generate vertical advection, while the associated horizontal advection tends to restratify the surface water of the column, and thus to inhibit very deep convection. Just before the end of the forcing period, 80-km meanders appear, which create advection strong enough to erase the column within two weeks. The associated horizontal cyclonic circulation is of the same order of magnitude as that estimated from observations.},

  abstract = {The states of thermal equilibrium (incorporating an adjustment of super-adiabatic stratification) as well as that of pure radiative equilibrium of the atmosphere are computed as the asymptotic steady state approached in an initial value problem. Recent measurements of absorptivities obtained for a wide range of pressure are used, and the scheme of computation is sufficiently general to include the effect of several layers of clouds. The atmosphere in thermal equilibrium has an isothermal lower stratosphere and an inversion in the upper stratosphere which are features observed in middle latitudes. The role of various gaseous absorbers (i.e., water vapor, carbon dioxide, and ozone), as well as the role of the clouds, is investigated by computing thermal equilibrium with and without one or two of these elements. The existence of ozone has very little effect on the equilibrium temperature of the earth's surface but a very important effect on the temperature throughout the stratosphere; the absorption of solar radiation by ozone in the upper and middle stratosphere, in addition to maintaining the warm temperature in that region, appears also to be necessary for the maintenance of the isothermal layer or slight inversion just above the tropopause. The thermal equilibrium state in the absence of solar insulation is computed by setting the temperature of the earth's surface at the observed polar value. In this case, the stratospheric temperature decreases monotonically with increasing altitude, whereas the corresponding state of pure radiative equilibrium has an inversion just above the level of the tropopause. A series of thermal equilibriums is computed for the distributions of absorbers typical of different latitudes. According to these results, the latitudinal variation of the distributions of ozone and water vapor may be partly responsible for the latitudinal variation of the thickness of the isothermal part of the stratosphere. Finally, the state of local radiative equilibrium of the stratosphere overlying a troposphere with the observed distribution of temperature is computed for each season and latitude. In the upper stratosphere of the winter hemisphere, a large latitudinal temperature gradient appears at the latitude of the polar-night jet stream, while in the upper statosphere of the summer hemisphere, the equilibrium temperature varies little with latitude. These features are consistent with the observed atmosphere. However, the computations predict an extremely cold polar night temperature in the upper stratosphere and a latitudinal decrease (toward the cold pole) of equilibrium temperature in the middle or lower stratosphere for winter and fall. This disagrees with observation, and suggests that explicit introduction of the dynamics of large scale motion is necessary.},

The quasi-hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic sets are more accurate than the widely used hydrostatic primitive equations. Quasi-hydrostatic models relax the precise balance between gravity and pressure gradient forces by including in a consistent manner cosine-of-latitude Coriolis terms which are neglected in primitive equation models. Nonhydrostatic models employ the full incompressible Navier Stokes equations; they are required in the study of small-scale phenomena in the ocean which are not in hydrostatic balance. We outline a solution strategy for the Navier Stokes model on the sphere that performs efficiently across the whole range of scales in the ocean, from the convective scale to the global scale, and so leads to a model of great versatility. In the hydrostatic limit the Navier Stokes model involves no more computational effort than those models which assume strict hydrostatic balance on all scales. The strategy is illustrated in simulations of laboratory experiments in rotating convection on scales of a few centimeters, simulations of convective and baroclinic instability of the mixed layer on the 1- to 10-km scale, and simulations of the global circulation of the ocean.},

The aim of this manuscript is to demonstrate that when energy conservation is satisfied in this manner, the growth or decay of the parameterized eddy energy relates naturally to the instability or stability of the flow as described by Arnold's first stability theorem. The resultant family of eddy closures therefore possesses some of the ingredients necessary to parameterize the gross effects of eddies in both forced-dissipative and freely-decaying turbulence. These ideas are illustrated through their application to idealized, barotropic wind-driven gyres in which the maximum eddy energy occurs within the viscous boundary layers and separated western boundary currents, and to freely-decaying turbulence in a closed barotropic basin in which inertial Fofonoff gyres emerge as the long-time solution. The result that these eddy closures preserve the relation between the growth or decay of eddy energy and the instability or stability of the flow provides further support for their use in ocean general circulation models.},

  abstract = {A quasi-oscillatory multi-centennial mode of open ocean deep convection in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean in the Kiel Climate Model is described. The quasi-periodic occurrence of the deep convection causes variations in regional and global surface air temperature, Southern Hemisphere sea ice coverage, Southern Ocean and North Atlantic sea surface height, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). The deep convection is stimulated by a strong built-up of heat at mid-depth. When the heat reservoir is virtually depleted a coincidental strong freshening event at the sea surface shuts down the convection. The heat originates from relatively warm deep water formed in the North Atlantic. The several decades lasting recharge process of the heat reservoir depends on the AMOC and the Weddell Gyre and sets a minimum delay for the deep convection to recur. While the strength of the AMOC increases, the Weddell Gyre weakens during the non-convective regime. Convection onset and shutdown also depend on the stochastic occurrence of favorable sea surface conditions, which contributes to the multi-centennial period of the phenomenon. The shutdown triggers a century-long deviation in AMOC strength caused by significant reductions in bottom water formation and surface salinity in the Southern Ocean's Atlantic sector. Additional numerical experimentation reveals that sea ice has an important effect on the frequency of occurrence and intensity of the deep convection. Further, we find intriguing similarities to the Weddell Polynya observed during the 1970s.},

  abstract = {Abstract Turbulent convection into a homogeneous, rotating fluid has been generated in laboratory tanks, for both laterally confined and unconfined domains. When a given experiment was in a solid-body rotation, a source located at the top surface of the water column was activated to release denser saltwater into the underlying, less-dense fluid of total depth H. As a result, a downward propagating 3D turbulent front was formed. Eventually, at a transition depth zc, rotational effects dominated the turbulence and many quasi-2D vortices were generated, which then penetrated downward beneath the upper 3D turbulent layer. Measurements in the confined experiments gave zc {$\approx$} (12.7 {\textpm} 1.5) (B0/f3)1/2; the mean diameter (Dv) of the quasi-2D vortices as Dv{$\approx$}(15.0{\textpm}1.5) (B0/f3)1/2, their downward speed of propagation (uc) as uc {$\approx$} (1.0 {\textpm} 0.1) (B0/f)1/2, and the maximum swirl velocity (uv) of an individual vortex as uv {$\approx$} (4.0 {\textpm} 0.4)(B0/f)1/2 (where B0 is the surface buoyancy flux and f the Coriolis parameter). All are in agreement with scaling predictions presented here and in a number of previous publications. In the unconfined experiments, when zc {$<$} H, the vortex columns of the type discussed above ``filled out'' after reaching the bottom, took on a conical shape, and then underwent a collective baroclinic instability with the resultant larger-scale vortices propagating away from beneath the source. The velocity field of the vortex columns extended throughout the water column and many vortices surrounded the source. The measured diameter (D) of the circle of maximum velocity was consistent with the scaling D/H {$\approx$} (5.2 {\textpm} 1)(Ro*)1/2, where Ro*=(B0/f3)1/2/fH=(B0/H2f3)1/2 is a natural Rossby number of the flow based on the characteristic vortex velocity. When zc {$>$} H, and the radius of the source (R) was of the same order as the fluid depth, the turbulent layer contacted the bottom directly without forming small-scale vortices, spread horizontally, and eventually baroclinic vortices formed at the edge of the spreading front or gravity current. The diameter of these vortices was consistent with the scaling D/H{$\approx$}(7.0 {\textpm} 1) (Ro*)2/3. Using an extension of the model of O. M. Phillips, it is suggested that this result should be modified by multiplying by a factor (R/H)1/3 when R/H) is large. When zc=H, then (Ro*)1/2 = 0.28, and this constitutes a transition Rossby number between the two regimes. These more extensive results are in agreement with previous theoretical predictions and limited experimental measurements by the authors. Results from the present study have been applied to convective events observed in the Golfe du Lion and the Arctic and a reasonable agreement found, especially when the finite size of the source was taken into account. Furthermore, it is concluded, based on the scaling results found here, that fluid of a density large enough to constitute ``bottom water'' can only be produced under circumstances that limit mixing with ambient fluid, for example, in an intense vortex column in deep water or under an extensive region of cooling in shallow water. Arguments favoring these possibilities are presented.},

  abstract = {Abstract Potential temperature is used in oceanography as though it is a conservative variable like salinity; however, turbulent mixing processes conserve enthalpy and usually destroy potential temperature. This negative production of potential temperature is similar in magnitude to the well-known production of entropy that always occurs during mixing processes. Here it is shown that potential enthalpy---the enthalpy that a water parcel would have if raised adiabatically and without exchange of salt to the sea surface---is more conservative than potential temperature by two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, it is shown that a flux of potential enthalpy can be called ``the heat flux'' even though potential enthalpy is undefined up to a linear function of salinity. The exchange of heat across the sea surface is identically the flux of potential enthalpy. This same flux is not proportional to the flux of potential temperature because of variations in heat capacity of up to 5\%. The geothermal heat flux across the ocean floor is also approximately the flux of potential enthalpy with an error of no more that 0.15\%. These results prove that potential enthalpy is the quantity whose advection and diffusion is equivalent to advection and diffusion of ``heat'' in the ocean. That is, it is proven that to very high accuracy, the first law of thermodynamics in the ocean is the conservation equation of potential enthalpy. It is shown that potential enthalpy is to be preferred over the Bernoulli function. A new temperature variable called ``conservative temperature'' is advanced that is simply proportional to potential enthalpy. It is shown that present ocean models contain typical errors of 0.1{$^\circ$}C and maximum errors of 1.4{$^\circ$}C in their temperature because of the neglect of the nonconservative production of potential temperature. The meridional flux of heat through oceanic sections found using this conservative approach is different by up to 0.4\% from that calculated by the approach used in present ocean models in which the nonconservative nature of potential temperature is ignored and the specific heat at the sea surface is assumed to be constant. An alternative approach that has been recommended and is often used with observed section data, namely, calculating the meridional heat flux using the specific heat (at zero pressure) and potential temperature, rests on an incorrect theoretical foundation, and this estimate of heat flux is actually less accurate than simply using the flux of potential temperature with a constant heat capacity.},

  abstract = {Abstract The phenomenon of oceanic Ekman layer rectification refers to how the time-mean, Ekman layer velocity profile with depth differs as a consequence of variability in the surface wind in addition to the time-mean wind. This study investigates rectification using the K-Profile Parameterization (KPP) model for the turbulent surface boundary layer under simple conditions of uniform density and no surface buoyancy flux or surface wave influences. The rectification magnitude is found to be significant under typical conditions. Its primary effects are to extend the depth profile deeper into the interior, reduce the mean shear, increase the effective eddy viscosity due to turbulent momentum mixing, and rotate slightly the surface velocity farther away from the mean wind direction. These effects are partly due to the increase in mean stress because of its quadratic dependence on wind speed but also are due to the nonlinearity of the turbulent mixing efficiency. The strongest influence on the rectification magnitude is the ratio of transient wind amplitude to mean wind speed. It is found that an accurate estimate of the mean current usually can be obtained by using a quasi-stationary approximation that is a weighted integral of the steady Ekman layer response over the probability density function for the wind, independent of the detailed wind history. Rectification occurs even for very high frequency wind fluctuations, though the accuracy of the quasi-steady approximation degrades in this limit (as does the validity of the KPP model). This theory is extended to include the effects of the horizontal component of the Coriolis frequency, f\,y. Based on published computational turbulence solutions, a simple parameterization is proposed that amplifies the turbulent eddy diffusivity in KPP by a factor that decreases with latitude and depends on the wind orientation. The effect of f\,y {$\neq$} 0 is to increase both the shear and the surface speed in the time-mean Ekman current for winds directed to the northeast and decrease both quantities for winds to the southwest, with weaker influences on these properties for the orthogonal directions of southeast and northwest. Furthermore, with transient winds there is significant coupling between f\,y {$\neq$} 0 and the rectification effect; for example, the mean surface current direction, relative to the mean wind, is significantly changed for these orthogonal directions.},

  abstract = {Characterization of the long-time behaviour of an invicid incompressible fluid evolving on a two-dimensional domain is a long-standing problem in physics. The motion is described by Euler's equations: a non-linear system with infinitely many conservations laws, yet non-integrable dynamics. In both experiments and numerical simulations, coherent vortex structures, or blobs, typically form after some stage of initial mixing. These formations dominate the slow, large-scale dynamics. Nevertheless, fast, small-scale dynamics also persist. Kraichnan, in his classical work, qualitatively describes a direct cascade of enstrophy into smaller scales and a backward cascade of energy into larger scales. Previous attempts to quantitatively model this double cascade are based on filtering-like techniques that enforce separation from the outset. Here we show that Euler's equations posess a natural, intrinsic splitting of the vorticity function. This canonical splitting is remarkable in four ways: (i) it is defined only in terms of the Poisson bracket and the Hamiltonian, (ii) it characterizes steady flows (equilibria), (iii) it genuinly, without imposition, evolves into a separation of scales, thus enabling the quantitative dynamics behind Kraichnan's qualitative description, and (iv) it accounts for the ``broken line'' in the power law for the energy spectrum (observed in both experiments and numerical simulations). The splitting originates from a quantized version of Euler's equations in combination with a standard quantum-tool: the spectral decomposition of Hermitian matrices. In addition to theoretical insight, the canonical scale separation dynamics might be used as a foundation for stochastic model reduction, where the small scales are modelled by suitable multiplicative noise.},

  abstract = {,                             The incompressible two-dimensional Euler equations on a sphere constitute a fundamental model in hydrodynamics. The long-time behaviour of solutions is largely unknown; statistical mechanics predicts a steady vorticity configuration, but detailed numerical results in the literature contradict this theory, yielding instead persistent unsteadiness. Such numerical results were obtained using artificial hyperviscosity to account for the cascade of enstrophy into smaller scales. Hyperviscosity, however, destroys the underlying geometry of the phase flow (such as conservation of Casimir functions), and therefore might affect the qualitative long-time behaviour. Here, we develop an efficient numerical method for long-time simulations that preserve the geometric features of the exact flow, in particular conservation of Casimirs. Long-time simulations on a non-rotating sphere then reveal three possible outcomes for generic initial conditions: the formation of either 2, 3 or 4 coherent vortex structures. These numerical results contradict the statistical mechanics theory and show that previous numerical results, suggesting 4 coherent vortex structures as the generic behaviour, display only a special case. Through integrability theory for point vortex dynamics on the sphere we present a theoretical model which describes the mechanism by which the three observed regimes appear. We show that there is a correlation between a first integral                                                                      \${\textbackslash}unicode[STIX]\{x1D6FE\}\$                                               (the ratio of total angular momentum and the square root of enstrophy) and the long-time behaviour:                                                                      \${\textbackslash}unicode[STIX]\{x1D6FE\}\$                                               small, intermediate and large yields most likely 4, 3 or 2 coherent vortex formations.

To describe the energy fluxes of non-isentropic fluids we propose a pseudo port-Hamiltonian formulation, which includes the rate of irreversible entropy creation by heat flux. For isentropic fluids, the conversion of kinetic energy into heat by viscous friction is considered as an energy dissipation associated with the rotation and compression of the fluid. Then, a dissipative port-Hamiltonian formulation is derived for this class of fluids. In the 2D case we modify the vorticity operators in order to preserve the structure of the proposed models. Moreover, we show that a description for inviscid or irrotational fluids can be derived from the proposed models under the corresponding assumptions leading to a pseudo or dissipative port-Hamiltonian structures.},

Motivation for this article comes from computational models that are deterministic, complicated enough to make classical mathematical analysis impractical and that have a moderate-to-large number of inputs. The problem of designing computational experiments to determine which inputs have important effects on an output is considered. The proposed experimental plans are composed of individually randomized one-factor-at-a-time designs, and data analysis is based on the resulting random sample of observed elementary effects, those changes in an output due solely to changes in a particular input. Advantages of this approach include a lack of reliance on assumptions of relative sparsity of important inputs, monotonicity of outputs with respect to inputs, or adequacy of a low-order polynomial as an approximation to the computational model.},

  abstract = {Without deep mixing, the ocean would turn, within a few thousand years, into a stagnant pool of cold salty water with equilibrium maintained locally by near-surface mixing and with very weak convectively driven surface-intensified circulation. (This result follows from Sandstr{\"o}m's theorem for a fluid heated and cooled at the surface.) In this context we revisit the 1966 ``Abyssal Recipes'', which called for a diapycnal diffusivity of 10-4m2/s (1cgs) to maintain the abyssal stratification against global upwelling associated with 25Sverdrups of deep water formation. Subsequent microstructure measurements gave a pelagic diffusivity (away from topography) of 10-5m2/s --- a low value confirmed by dye release experiments. A new solution (without restriction to constant coefficients) leads to approximately the same values of global upwelling and diffusivity, but we reinterpret the computed diffusivity as a surrogate for a small number of concentrated sources of buoyancy flux (regions of intense mixing) from which the water masses (but not the turbulence) are exported into the ocean interior. Using the Levitus climatology we find that 2.1TW (terawatts) are required to maintain the global abyssal density distribution against 30Sverdrups of deep water formation. The winds and tides are the only possible source of mechanical energy to drive the interior mixing. Tidal dissipation is known from astronomy to equal 3.7 TW (2.50{\textpm}0.05TW from M2 alone), but nearly all of this has traditionally been allocated to dissipation in the turbulent bottom boundary layers of marginal seas. However, two recent TOPEX/POSEIDON altimetric estimates combined with dynamical models suggest that 0.6--0.9TW may be available for abyssal mixing. A recent estimate of wind-driving suggests 1TW of additional mixing power. All values are very uncertain. A surprising conclusion is that the equator-to-pole heat flux of 2000TW associated with the meridional overturning circulation would not exist without the comparatively minute mechanical mixing sources. Coupled with the findings that mixing occurs at a few dominant sites, there is a host of questions concerning the maintenance of the present climate state, but also that of paleoclimates and their relation to detailed continental configurations, the history of the Earth--Moon system, and a possible great sensitivity to details of the wind system.},

Our probability density function is constrained by objective estimates of the relative reliability of different model versions, the choice of model parameters that are varied and their uncertainty ranges, specified on the basis of expert advice. Our ensemble produces a range of regional changes much wider than indicated by traditional methods based on scaling the response patterns of an individual simulation5,6.},

The advection--diffusion decomposition that defines EDMF is projected onto the turbulent distribution as used in the statistical cloud model. Each EDMF component is thus assigned its own independent probability density function (PDF), resulting in an updraft PDF and a diffusive PDF. This double PDF system is configured and integrated in conserved variable space, with the position and orientation of each PDF determined by its unique nature. The parameterization of the associated updraft/diffusion decomposition of variance introduces close ties to the transport scheme; whereas the grid box mean variance is reconstructed using a prognostic variance budget, the variance of the updraft component is parameterized as a function of the spread among various resolved model updrafts. Individual model components and the scheme as a whole are evaluated in detail against large-eddy simulations of a number of prototype subtropical trade wind cases. The results show that various structures in cloud fraction, condensate, and variance are reproduced. The diffusive PDF acts to represent stratiform clouds; the advective PDF represents cumuliform clouds in conditionally unstable layers. This allows representation of complex scenarios in which both cloud forms occur, such as the transitional trade wind regime featuring cumulus rising into stratocumulus.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses three-wave resonant interactions of Rossby-Haurwitz waves in two-dimensional turbulence on a rotating sphere. Zonal modes are often omitted from the ``resonant wave set'' even when they satisfy the conditions for three-wave resonant interactions, as they do not transfer any energy to other modes in a resonant manner. However, the presence of zonal flows induces phase shifts in other modes, and it is not at all clear that their influence is negligible. Since it is expected that three-wave resonant interactions govern the entire dynamics of turbulence if the rotation rate of the sphere is sufficiently high, by analogy with the theorem regarding three-wave resonant interactions of Rossby waves on a {$\beta$} plane with sufficiently large {$\beta$} previously proven by Yamada and Yoneda [Physica D 245, 1 (2013)], an appropriate definition of the resonant wave set was determined by comparing the time evolution of several wave sets on a rapidly rotating sphere. It was found that zonal waves of the form Ym=0lexp(i{$\omega$}t) with odd l, where Yml are the spherical harmonics, should be considered for inclusion in the resonant wave set to ensure that the dynamics of the resonant wave set determine the overall dynamics of the turbulence on a rapidly rotating sphere. Consequently, it is suggested that the minimal resonant wave set that must be considered in the discussion of the three-wave interaction of Rossby-Haurwitz waves is the set consisting of nonzonal resonant waves and zonal waves of the form Y0lexp(i{$\omega$}t) with odd l.},

  abstract = {An energetically consistent model for the diapycnal diffusivity induced by breaking of internal gravity waves is proposed and tested in local and global settings. The model [Internal Wave Dissipation, Energy and Mixing (IDEMIX)] is based on the spectral radiation balance of the wave field, reduced by integration over the wavenumber space, which yields a set of balances for energy density variables in physical space. A further simplification results in a single partial differential equation for the total energy density of the wave field. The flux of energy to high vertical wavenumbers is parameterized by a functional derived from the wave--wave scattering integral of resonant wave triad interactions, which also forms the basis for estimates of dissipation rates and related diffusivities of ADCP and hydrography fine-structure data. In the current version of IDEMIX, the wave energy is forced by wind-driven near-inertial motions and baroclinic tides, radiating waves from the respective boundary layers at the surface and the bottom into the ocean interior. The model predicts plausible magnitudes and three-dimensional structures of internal wave energy, dissipation rates, and diapycnal diffusivities in rough agreement to observational estimates. IDEMIX is ready for use as a mixing module in ocean circulation models and can be extended with more spectral components.},

In this paper two models for the source of oceanic turbulence are considered; namely, production by the Reynolds stress working against a time variable mean shear, and the gravitational collapse of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. Both of these shear instabilities are believed to be important in the ocean. Using values for the critical flux Richardson number and the measurements from studies of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, the efficiency of turbulent mixing is shown to be comparable for the two models. Therefore, a general relationship between the dissipation rate and the buoyancy flux due to the small-scale turbulent velocity fluctuations is derived.

We also see the formation of baroclinic vortices and a rim current at the interface of the mixed and surrounding fluids at high rotation rates.

The parameterization scheme takes the temperature and salinity profiles of OGCM grid boxes and simulates the subgrid-scale effects of convection using a one-dimensional parcel model. The model moves water parcels from the surface layer down to their level of neutral buoyancy, simulating the effect of convective plumes. While in transit, the plumes exchange water with the surrounding environment; however, the bulk of the plume water mass is deposited at e level of neutral buoyancy. Weak upwelling around the plumes is included to maintain an overall mass balance. The process continues until the negative buoyant energy of the one-dimensional vertical column is minimized. The parameterized plume entrainment rate, which plays a central role in the parameterization, is calculated using modified equations based on the physics of entraining buoyant plumes. This scheme differs from the convective adjustment techniques currently used in OGCMs, because the parcels penetrate downward with the appropriate degree of mixing until they reach their level of neutral stability.},

  abstract = {Abstract The primary goal of this paper is to validate the use of the anelastic approximation for fluids with a complex equation of state such as moist air or seawater. The anelastic approximation is based on a leading-order expansion of the equations of motion for a compressible fluid in terms of density. Its application to atmospheric flows has been based on a dry framework that treats phase transitions as an external energy source. However, cloudy air is more accurately described as a two-phase fluid in which condensed water and water vapor are in thermodynamic equilibrium. Thermodynamic equilibrium reduces to three the number of state variables necessary to describe the thermodynamic state of moist air, and leads to a discontinuity in the partial derivatives of the equation of state at the saturation point. A version of the anelastic approximation for a moist atmosphere is derived here by considering the atmospheric density as a small perturbation from a moist-adiabatic reference profile, and using moist entropy and total water content as prognostic variables, with buoyancy determined from the complete nonlinear equation of state. The key finding of this paper is that this implementation of the anelastic approximation conserves energy. The total energy is equal to the sum of the kinetic energy and the thermodynamic energy. The latter is found to be equal to the sum of the enthalpy and geopotential energy of the parcel. Furthermore, the state relationships between this thermodynamic energy, entropy, and other state variables are the same as those for moist air after replacing the total pressure with the reference state pressure. This guarantees that, as long as the pressure perturbation remains small, the thermodynamic behavior of a fluid under the anelastic approximation is fully consistent with both the first and second laws of thermodynamics. Two implications of this finding are also discussed. First, it is shown that the first and second laws of thermodynamics constrain the vertically integrated buoyancy flux. This is equivalent to deriving the total work performed in a compressible atmosphere from its entropy and energy budgets. Second, it is argued that an anelastic model can be built with temperature or enthalpy as a prognostic variable instead of entropy. The rate of change for this new state variable can be obtained from energy conservation, so that such a model explicitly obeys the first law of thermodynamics. The entropy in this model is equal to the entropy of the parcel evaluated at the reference pressure, and its evolution obeys the second law of thermodynamics.},

  abstract = {The transport of a pollutant in the ocean or atmosphere is influenced strongly by both the prevailing large-scale mean flow structure and disordered turbulent motion prevalent on smaller scales. To obtain some insight into the effects of turbulent transport, various authors over the last decade have studied the transport of material in model flows which have a periodic structure. For such flows, one can develop a rigorous homogenization theory to describe their effective transport on large scales. We will present an extension of these homogenization studies to a class of model flows which consist of a superposition of a large-scale mean flow with a small-scale periodic structure (both of which can depend on space and time). Using two-scale convergence and higher order homogenization techniques, we rigorously derive homogenized equations for these models, in which the mean flow and periodic structure are shown to interact nonlinearly. The small-scale structure is responsible for an enhancement in the diffusivity as well as for the presence of an effective drift, both of which are functions of space and time. The effective drift generated in our model provides a concrete and computable instance of the ``skew-flux'' appearing in turbulence parametrization schemes in atmosphere-ocean science. The remarkable variability of the effective drift and diffusivity is illustrated through a simple example.},

This article introduces a methodology for building physically realistic approximations of existing bulk formulae which would also satisfy suitable mathematical properties (explicit character, regularity, differentiability). This is achieved by applying the Sobol' method to compute sensitivity indices in order to reduce the number of inputs and derive a simple metamodel for the parametrization of turbulent air--sea fluxes. Numerical results show excellent agreement between our approximations and the standard bulk formulae.

  abstract = {Standard methods for determining air--sea fluxes typically rely on bulk algorithms set in the frame of Monin--Obukhov similarity theory (MOST), using ocean surface fields and atmosphere near-surface fields. In the context of coupled ocean--atmosphere simulations, the shallowest ocean vertical level is usually used as bulk input and, by default, the turbulent closure is one-sided: it extrapolates atmosphere near-surface solution profiles (for wind speed, temperature, and humidity) to the prescribed ocean surface values. Using near-surface ocean fields as surface ones is equivalent to considering that, in the ocean surface layer, solution profiles are constant instead of also being determined by turbulent closure. Here we introduce a method for extending existing turbulent parameterizations to a two-sided framework by explicitly including the ocean surface layer within the aforementioned parameterizations. The formalism we use for this method is derived from that of classical turbulent closures, so that our novelties can easily be implemented within existing formulations. Special care is taken to ensure the smoothness of the resulting solution profiles. Other physical phenomena, such as the penetration of radiative fluxes in the ocean and the formation of waves, are then included within our formalism, and their effects are assessed. We also investigate the impact of such two-sided bulk formulations on air--sea fluxes evaluated from a setting similar to those of coupled ocean--atmosphere simulations.},

The mass flux formulation of convective mixing is now largely accepted as an efficient approach for parameterizing the contribution of larger plumes in convective dry and cloudy boundary layers. We propose a new formulation of the EDMF scheme (for Eddy Diffusivity{\textbackslash}Mass Flux) based on a single updraft that improves the representation of dry thermals and shallow convective clouds and conserves a correct representation of stratocumulus in mesoscale models. The definition of entrainment and detrainment in the dry part of the updraft is original, and is specified as proportional to the ratio of buoyancy to vertical velocity. In the cloudy part of the updraft, the classical buoyancy sorting approach is chosen. The main closure of the scheme is based on the mass flux near the surface, which is proportional to the sub-cloud layer convective velocity scale w *. The link with the prognostic grid-scale cloud content and cloud cover and the projection on the non- conservative variables is processed by the cloud scheme. The validation of this new formulation using large-eddy simulations focused on showing the robustness of the scheme to represent three different boundary layer regimes. For dry convective cases, this parameterization enables a correct representation of the countergradient zone where the mass flux part represents the top entrainment (IHOP case). It can also handle the diurnal cycle of boundary-layer cumulus clouds (EUROCS{\textbackslash}ARM) and conserve a realistic evolution of stratocumulus (EUROCS{\textbackslash}FIRE).},

  abstract = {A convective vertical mixing scheme rooted in the Eddy-Diffusivity Mass-Flux (EDMF) approach is carefully derived from first principles. This type of closure involves separating vertical turbulent fluxes into two components: an eddy-diffusivity (ED) term that addresses local small-scale mixing in a near isotropic environment, and a mass-flux (MF) transport term that accounts for the non-local transport performed by vertically coherent plumes within the environment. Using the multi-fluid averaging underlying the MF concept, we present consistent energy budgets between resolved and subgrid scales for seawater and dry atmosphere. We show that when using an EDMF scheme, closed energy budgets can be recovered if: (i) bulk production terms of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) by shear, buoyancy and transport include MF contributions; (ii) boundary conditions are consistent with EDMF, to avoid spurious energy fluxes at the boundary. The performance of the energetically consistent EDMF scheme is evaluated against Large Eddy Simulations (LES) and observational data of oceanic convection. Notably, energetic consistency is key to obtaining accurate TKE and turbulent transport of TKE profiles when compared to LES data. Throughout the theoretical development of the scheme, we maintain transparency regarding underlying assumptions and systematically assess their validity in the light of LES data.},

When the density stratification exceeds a threshold, or when the impermeability condition at the boundary is relaxed, atmospheric Lamb waves suddenly disappear5. Here, we use topological arguments to predict the possible existence of new trapped Lamb-like waves in the absence of a solid boundary, depending on the stratification profile. The topological origin of the Lamb-like waves is emphasized by relating their existence to two-band crossing points carrying opposite Chern numbers. The existence of these band crossings coincides with a restoration of the vertical mirror symmetry that is in general broken by gravity. From this perspective, Lamb-like waves also bear strong similarities with boundary modes encountered in the quantum valley Hall effect6--8 and its classical analogues9--11. Our study shows that the presence of Lamb-like waves encodes essential information on the underlying stratification profile in astrophysical and geophysical flows, which is often poorly constrained by observations.},

Effective buoyancy is the statically forced component of the vertical gradient in the nonhydrostatic pressure field. The diagnostic expressions derived herein show that the effective buoyancy of an updraft is dependent on the magnitude of the temperature perturbation within an updraft relative to the air along the updraft's immediate periphery (rather than relative to an arbitrary base state as in ), the updraft's height-to-width aspect ratio, and the updraft's slant relative to the vertical. The diagnostic expressions are significantly improved over parcel theory (where pressure forces are ignored) in their portrayal of the vertical profile of w through updrafts from a cloud model simulation and accurately diagnosed the maximum vertical velocity wmax within updrafts. The largest improvements to the diagnostic expressions over parcel theory resulted from their dependence on rather than . Whereas the actual wmax within simulated updrafts was located approximately two-thirds to three-fourths of the distance between the updraft base and the updraft top, wmax within profiles diagnosed by expressions was portrayed at the updraft top when the dynamic pressure force was ignored. A rudimentary theoretical representation of the dynamic pressure force in the diagnostic expressions improved their portrayal of the simulated w profile. These results augment the conceptual understanding of convective updrafts and provide avenues for improving the representation of vertical mass flux in cumulus parameterizations.},

The vertical profiles of cloud properties are determined by analytic equations, which formulate entrainment with an inverse relationship to cloud width. In line with recent studies of large eddy simulations (LES), cloud widths are assumed to be constant with height and vertical mass flux (M) characteristics of the clouds are therefore regulated by the vertical velocity profile. The parameterization is configured to work with existing cloud base M closure formulations, with the closure predicting the total cloud area rather than the cloud base M directly. Analytic formula are also used to connect the vertical wind shear magnitude to the cloud size distribution, wherein larger shear magnitudes result in more numerous large updrafts than weaker shear magnitudes, which is in line with recent research results. The parameterization is compared against 10 deep convective LES with varying thermodynamic and vertical wind shear profiles. Results show dramatic improvements in the prediction of normalized M, detrainment, and the properties of detrained air over the existing Zhang and McFarlane (1995) scheme. In particular, the new model is able to correctly portray the transition from a bottom-heavy M profile in weakly sheared environments, to a top-heavy M profile in strongly sheared environments.},

  abstract = {Analysis of Argo data obtained during winter 2011--2012 revealed the presence over the Irminger Basin of an exceptionally large number of profiles (41) with mixed layer depths (MLD) exceeding 700m, which was deep enough to reach the pool of the intermediate Labrador Sea Water located in the Irminger Sea. Four of these profiles exhibited an MLD of 1000m, which was the maximum value observed for the winter in question. The Argo sampling in the Irminger Sea during that winter, which was 3--4 times greater than for the preceding winters, enabled the different phases of the mixed layer deepening down to 1000m, together with their spatial extents, to be observed for the first time. Two intense convective periods occurred: in late January south of Cape Farewell and in late February-early March east of Greenland. A final deepening period was observed in mid-March, during which the deepest mixed layers were observed. This long deepening period occurred in large regional areas and was followed by a rapid restratification phase. The temporal evolution of oxygen profiles from one Argo float testifies to the local and rapid ventilation of the mixed layer by the deep convection. A mixed layer heat budget along the trajectories of the 4 floats that sampled the deepest mixed layers showed that heat loss at the air-sea interface was mainly responsible for heat content variations in the mixed layer. Greenland Tip Jets were of primary importance for the development of deep convection in the Irminger Sea in the winter of 2011--2012. They enhanced the winter heat loss and two long (more than 24h), intense late events close together in time pushed the mixed layer deepening down to 1000m. Net air-sea fluxes, the number of Greenland Tip Jets, the stratification of the water column, the NAO index and the Ekman-induced heat flux are pertinent indicators to assess conditions that are favorable for the development of deep convection in the Irminger Sea. By considering each of those indicators, it was concluded that the 2011--2012 event was not significantly different from the three other documented occurrences of deep convection in the Irminger Sea.},

In this paper, we raise some fundamental questions concerning the conceptual foundations of LES and about the methodologies and protocols used in its application. The 10 questions addressed are stated at the end of the introduction. Several of these questions highlight the importance of recognizing the dependence of LES calculations on the artificial parameter {$\Delta$} (i.e. the filter width or, more generally, the turbulence resolution length scale). The principle that LES predictions of turbulence statistics should depend minimally on {$\Delta$} provides an alternative justification for the dynamic procedure.},

  abstract = {A steady ideal fluid flow on a surface corresponds to a geodesic in the area-preserving diffeomorphism group. The sign of the curvature operator along this geodesic has been of interest since Arnold noticed its connection to Lagrangian stability of the flow: nonpositive curvature implies by the Rauch comparison theorem that Lagrangian perturbations grow at least linearly in time. We obtain a new necessary and sufficient criterion for a steady flow with analytic stream function and isolated zeroes to have nonpositive curvature operator: either the surface is a flat torus, and the fluid flow has constant pressure; or the surface is a sphere, disc, or annulus with a globally-defined polar coordinate system such that the metric is ds2=dr2+{$\phi$}2(r)d{\texttheta}2. In the latter case, the velocity field must be of the form X=u(r){$\partial\theta$}. Furthermore, the function Q=(u{$\phi\prime$}){$\prime$}/u{$\prime$} must be defined for every r and satisfy the differential inequality {$\phi$}Q{$\prime$}+Q2{$\leq$}1. This criterion is proved by using a new formula for the curvature of the area-preserving diffeomorphism group in the rotationally symmetric case, involving only first integrals in one variable, rather than infinite sums or the solution of a PDE. Elementary consequences of the criterion are also discussed: for example, there are no flows with nonpositive curvature operator on the standard round sphere; and on a flat surface, every rotationally symmetric flow has nonpositive curvature operator. Finally we show that if a steady flow satisfies both this nonpositive curvature criterion and the well-known Eulerian stability criterion of Arnold, then all Lagrangian perturbations grow polynomially in time, in the L2 norm. Thus this is the first time methods of Riemannian geometry have given rigorous information on stability.},

  abstract = {Abstract A large-eddy simulation model (LES) has been applied to study deep convective processes in a stratified ocean driven by the energetic cooling at the ocean surface. Closely related to a recent laboratory experiment, the numerical experiment deals with the inverted problem of the growth of a convective mixed layer driven by a localized source of bottom heating in a rotating, stably stratified fluid. In general, good agreement is found between numerical and laboratory results. After onset of the heating a well-mixed layer forms above the heated circular surface. Although small-scale turbulence quantities like rms velocities and length scale can be best described by the nonrotating turbulent velocity and length scales, they are also found to differ significantly from a nonrotating control run, which indicates that rotation affects but does not control the turbulence. Due to the horizontal radial temperature gradient between the mixed layer and the ambient fluid a rim current develops around the periphery of the heated surface. Its near-surface maximum can be well described by a simple thermal wind law. The strong counterrotating current also observed in the laboratory at greater heights above the surface is found to be mainly driven by surface friction and should not be observed in the ocean. As time progresses, the rim current becomes unstable, eventually generating a field of baroclinic eddies that stop the mixed layer growth by causing some horizontal exchange between the convective layer and its cooler surrounding. The wavelength of the instabilities slowly increases with time and is clearly related to the local Rossby radius.},

Starting from complex climate models, a key difficulty is to be able to run long enough simulations to observe those extremely rare events. In physics, chemistry, and biology, rare event algorithms have recently been developed to compute probabilities of events that cannot be observed in direct numerical simulations. Here we propose such an algorithm, specifically designed for extreme heat or cold waves, based on statistical physics. This approach gives an improvement of more than two orders of magnitude in the sampling efficiency. We describe the dynamics of events that would not be observed otherwise. We show that European extreme heat waves are related to a global teleconnection pattern involving North America and Asia.

In order for such models to be useful, it is necessary to determine the fractional area covered by rising motion in the convective circulations. This fraction can be used as an estimate of the cloud amount, under certain conditions. ``Matching'' conditions have been developed that relate the convective mass flux to the ventilation and entrainment mass fluxes. These are based on conservation equations for the scalar means and variances in the entrainment and ventilation layers. Methods are presented to determine both the fractional area covered by rising motion and the convective mass flux. The requirement of variance balance is used to relax the ``well-mixed'' assumption. The vertical structures of the mean state and the turbulent fluxes are determined analytically. Several aspects of this simple model's formulation are evaluated using results from large-eddy simulations.},

The second novelty is that the port-Hamiltonian model is constructed as the interconnection of a small set of building blocks of open energetic subsystems. Depending only on the choice of subsystems one composes and their energy-aware interconnection, the geometric description of a wide range of fluid dynamical systems can be achieved. The constructed port-Hamiltonian models include a number of inviscid fluid dynamical systems with variable boundary conditions. Namely, compressible isentropic flow, compressible adiabatic flow, and incompressible flow. Furthermore, all the derived fluid flow models are valid covariantly and globally on n-dimensional Riemannian manifolds using differential geometric tools of exterior calculus.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a method to parameterize vertical turbulent mixing coefficients within the ocean surface boundary layer (OSBL) for climate applications. The new method is specifically constructed to satisfy two requirements. The first aspect is to explicitly consider the mechanical energy budget of the turbulence that drives mixing. This constraint ensures a realistic and robust simulation of the OSBL, which is critical for coupled climate simulations. The second aspect is that the model should be formulated so that it is not sensitive to the numerical limitations common to climate simulations, such as long time-steps and coarse vertical grids. This goal is achieved by combining an existing resolved shear-driven mixing parameterization (here Jackson et~al., 2008) with a new method to avoid time step sensitivity. The new method is motivated by the Kraus-Turner-Niiler type bulk boundary layer parameterization, but relaxes the requirement for vertical homogeneity. The non-dimensional coefficients m* and n* from the Kraus-Turner-Niiler approach are parameterized for the new method based on results of simulations using a previously tested parameterization at high resolution. The resulting parameterization is evaluated by comparing simulations with the new parameterization to simulations with the k-{$\epsilon$} parameterization over a wide range of combinations of surface wind stress, surface buoyancy flux, and latitudes. The new method for vertical turbulent OSBL mixing is therefore proposed as a computationally efficient, implicitly energetically constrained option appropriate for ocean climate modeling applications.},

  abstract = {Stochastic subgrid parameterizations enable ensemble forecasts of fluid dynamic systems and ultimately accurate data assimilation (DA). Stochastic advection by Lie transport (SALT) and models under location uncertainty (LU) are recent and similar physically based stochastic schemes. SALT dynamics conserve helicity, whereas LU models conserve kinetic energy (KE). After highlighting general similarities between LU and SALT frameworks, this paper focuses on their common challenge: the parameterization choice. We compare uncertainty quantification skills of a stationary heterogeneous data-driven parameterization and a non-stationary homogeneous self-similar parameterization. For stationary, homogeneous surface quasigeostrophic (SQG; QG) turbulence, both parameterizations lead to high-quality ensemble forecasts. This paper also discusses a heterogeneous adaptation of the homogeneous parameterization targeted at a better simulation of strong straight buoyancy fronts.},

The modified parameterization is validated in a 1D configuration against results of large eddy simulations (LES), as well as in a 3D configuration against in situ measurements, for a series of cases of dry and cloudy convective boundary layers. Accounting for coherent structures of the mixed layer with the mass-flux scheme improves the representation of the diurnal cycle of the boundary layer, particularly its progressive deepening during the day and the associated near-surface drying.

  abstract = {Abstract In many large-scale models mass-flux parameterizations are applied to prognose the effect of cumulus cloud convection on the large-scale environment. Key parameters in the mass-flux equations are the lateral entrainment and detrainment rates. The physical meaning of these parameters is that they quantify the mixing rate of mass across the thermal boundaries between the cloud and its environment. The prognostic equations for the updraft and downdraft value of a conserved variable are used to derive a prognostic variance equation in the mass-flux approach. The analogy between this equation and the Reynolds-averaged variance equation is discussed. It is demonstrated that the prognostic variance equation formulated in mass-flux variables contains a gradient-production, transport, and dissipative term. In the latter term, the sum of the lateral entrainment and detrainment rates represents an inverse timescale of the dissipation. Steady-state solutions of the variance equations are discussed. Expressions for the fractional entrainment and detrainment coefficients are derived. Also, solutions for the vertical flux of an arbitrary conserved variable are presented. For convection in which the updraft fraction equals the downdraft fraction, the vertical flux of the scalar flows down the local mean gradient. The turbulent mixing coefficient is given by the ratio of the vertical mass flux and the sum of the fractional entrainment and detrainment coefficients. For an arbitrary updraft fraction, however, flux correction terms are part of the solution. It is shown that for a convective boundary layer these correction terms can account for countergradient transport, which is illustrated from large eddy simulation results. In the cumulus convection limit the vertical flux flows down the ``cloud'' gradient. It is concluded that in the mass-flux approach the turbulent mixing coefficients, and the correction terms that arise from the transport term, are very similar to closures applied to the Reynolds-averaged equations.},

  abstract = {Abstract The application of a steady-state vertical velocity equation for parameterized moist convective updrafts in climate and weather prediction models is currently common practice. This equation usually contains an advection, a buoyancy, and a lateral entrainment term, whereas the effects of pressure gradient and subplume contributions are typically incorporated as proportionality constants a and b for the buoyancy and the entrainment terms, respectively. A summary of proposed values of these proportionality constants a and b in the literature demonstrates that there is a large uncertainty in their most appropriate values. To shed new light on this situation an analysis is presented of the full vertical budget equation for shallow cumulus clouds obtained from large eddy simulations of three different Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) Cloud System Study (GCSS) intercomparison cases. It is found that the pressure gradient term is the dominant sink term in the vertical velocity budget, whereas the entrainment term only gives a small contribution. This result is at odds with the parameterized vertical velocity equation in the literature as it employs the entrainment term as the major sink term. As a practical solution the damping effect of the pressure term may be parameterized in terms of the lateral entrainment rates as used for thermodynamic quantities like the total specific humidity. By using a least squares method, case-dependent optimal values are obtained for the proportionality constants a and b, which are linearly related with each other. This relation can be explained from a linear relationship between the lateral entrainment rate and the buoyancy.},

  abstract = {Abstract In the present investigation we propose a simple theory to explain how a veering environmental wind shear vector can cause an initially symmetric updraft to grow preferentially to the right of the shear vector and acquire cyclonic rotation. The explanation offered is based on linear theory which predicts that interaction of the mean shear with the updraft produces favorable vertical pressure gradients along its right flank. To asses the validity of linear theory for large-amplitude updrafts, the three-dimensional, shallow, anelastic equations are numerically integrated using a simple parameterization for latent heating within a cloud and the linear and nonlinear forcing terms are separately analyzed. These results suggest that although the nonlinear effects strongly promote splitting of the updraft, the linear forcing remains the dominant factor in preferentially enhancing updraft growth on the right flank. We believe this differential forcing is a major contributor to the observed predominance of cyclonically rotating, right moving storms.},

Its only truly distinctive features then arise from the distinctive feature of fluid dynamics as a field theory, namely, the particle-relabelling symmetry property, which corresponds by Noether's theorem to the many vorticity conservation laws of fluid mechanics. The key feature of the formulation is that all the dependent variables depend on a common set of space--time coordinates. This feature permits an easy and transparent derivation of the GLM equations by use of the energy--momentum tensor formalism. The particle-relabelling symmetry property leads to the GLM potential vorticity law in which pseudo-momentum is the only wave activity term present. Thus the particle-relabelling symmetry explains the prominent importance of pseudo-momentum in GLM theory.},

Given a mathematical or computational model y=f(x1,x2,{\dots},xk), where the input factors xi's are uncorrelated with one another, one can see y as the realization of a stochastic process obtained by sampling each of the xi from its marginal distribution. The sensitivity indices are related to the decomposition of the variance of y into terms either due to each xi taken singularly (first order indices), as well as into terms due to the cooperative effects of more than one xi. In this paper we assume that one has computed the full set of first order sensitivity indices as well as the full set of total-order sensitivity indices (a~fairly common strategy in sensitivity analysis), and show that in this case the same set of model evaluations can be used to compute double estimates of: \&\#x02022;the total effect of two factors taken together, for all such k2 couples, where k is the dimensionality of the model;\&\#x02022;the total effect of k-2 factors taken together, for all k2 such (k-2) ples. We further introduce a new strategy for the computation of the full sets of first plus total order sensitivity indices that is about 50\% cheaper in terms of model evaluations with respect to previously published works. We discuss separately the case where the input factors xi's are not independent from each other.},

The Rayleigh number is effectively infinite, the Froude number of the stable layer is 0.09 and the surface roughness height relative to the height of the convective layer is varied between 10               -6               and 10               -2               . The LES uses a finite-difference method to integrate the three-dimensional grid-volume-averaged Navier--Stokes equations for a Boussinesq fluid. Subgrid-scale (SGS) fluxes are determined from algebraically approximated second-order closure (SOC) transport equations for which all essential coefficients are determined from the inertial-range theory. The surface boundary condition uses the Monin--Obukhov relationships. A radiation boundary condition at the top of the computational domain prevents spurious reflections of gravity waves. The simulation uses 160 {\texttimes} 160 {\texttimes} 48 grid cells. In the asymptotic state, the results in terms of vertical mean profiles of turbulence statistics generally agree very well with results available from laboratory and atmospheric field experiments. We found less agreement with respect to horizontal velocity fluctuations, pressure fluctuations and dissipation rates, which previous investigations tend to overestimate. Horizontal spectra exhibit an inertial subrange. The entrainment heat flux at the top of the CBL is carried by cold updraughts and warm downdraughts in the form of wisps at scales comparable with the height of the boundary layer. Plots of instantaneous flow fields show a spoke pattern in the lower quarter of the CBL which feeds large-scale updraughts penetrating into the stable layer aloft. The spoke pattern has also been found in a few previous investigations. Small-scale plumes near the surface and remote from strong updraughts do not merge together but decay while rising through large-scale downdraughts. The structure of updraughts and downdraughts is identified by three-dimensional correlation functions and conditionally averaged fields. The mean circulation extends vertically over the whole boundary layer. We find that updraughts are composed of quasi-steady large-scale plumes together with transient rising thermals which grow in size by lateral entrainment. The skewness of the vertical velocity fluctuations is generally positive but becomes negative in the lowest mesh cells when the dissipation rate exceeds the production rate due to buoyancy near the surface, as is the case for very rough surfaces. The LES results are used to determine the root-mean-square value of the surface friction velocity and the mean temperature difference between the surface and the mixed layer as a function of the roughness height. The results corroborate a simple model of the heat transfer in the surface layer.},

  abstract = {Boussinesq's hypothesis is at the heart of eddy viscosity models, which are used in many different fields to model turbulent flows. In its present time formulation, this hypothesis corresponds to an alignment between the Reynolds stress and mean strain tensors. We begin with historical remarks on Boussinesq's results and recall that he introduced a local averaging twenty years before Reynolds, but using an approach that prevented him from discovering Reynolds' stress tensor. We then introduce an indicator that characterizes the validity of this hypothesis. For experimental and numerical databases, when the tensors are known, this can be used to directly estimate the validity of this hypothesis. We show, using several different databases, that this hypothesis is almost never verified. We address, in conclusion, the analogy with kinetic theory, and the reason why this analogy cannot be applied, in general, for turbulent flows. To cite this article: F.G. Schmitt, C. R.

  abstract = {Abstract During December 1991 to April 1992 measurements with moored acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) stations and shipboard surveys were carried out in the convection regime of the Gulf of Lions, northwestern Mediterranean. First significant mixed layer deepening and generation of internal waves in the stratified intermediate layer occurred during a mistral cooling phase in late December. Mixed layer deepening to about 400 m, eroding the salinity maximum layer of saltier and warmer Levantine Intermediate Water and causing temporary surface-layer warming, followed during a second cooling period of late January. During a mistral cooling period from 18 to 23 February 1992, convection to 1500-m depth was observed, where the size of the convection regime was 50--100 km extent. Vertical velocities 40--640 m deep, recorded by four ADCPs of a triangular moored array of 2 km sidelength in the center of the convection regime, exceeded 5 cm s-1 and were not correlated over the separation of the moorings. Horizontal scales estimated from event duration and advection velocity were only around 500 m, in agreement with scaling arguments for convective plumes. Plume activity during nighttime cooling was larger than daytime daytime. Significant evidence for rotation of the plumes could not be found. Overall, plume energy, and the degree of mixing accomplished by them, was much lower than observed during a stronger mistral in February 1987. The mean vertical velocity over the mistral period, determined from the four ADCPs, was near zero, confirming the role of plumes as mixing agents rather than as part of a mean downdraft in a convection regime. The cyclonic rim current around the convection regime was confined to a strip of {$<$}20 km width with an average velocity of about 10 cm s-1, which is in agreement with near-zero vertical mean velocity in the interior based on potential vorticity conservation. A relation between variations of the larger-scale cyclonic North Mediterranean Current along the boundary and the deep convection could not be identified. An unexplained feature still is the cover of the convection regime by a shallow layer of light water that moves in rather quickly from the sides after the cooling ends.},

In the laboratory, the misalignment, characterized by the angle \${\textbackslash}alpha\$, between the buoyancy force (`effective' free-fall acceleration \$\{{\textbackslash}bm g\}\_e\$) and the rotation axis \$\{{\textbackslash}bm {\textbackslash}Omega\}\$ is produced by using the centrifugal force: an experimental tank was placed at a large distance from the centre of the turntable. The mathematical analogy between the laboratory model and the oceanic environment is presented. For \${\textbackslash}alpha{\textbackslash},\{=\}{\textbackslash},30{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$, a number of laboratory experiments spanning a wide range of the buoyancy flux parameter, and correspondingly Reynolds number, is used to illustrate the development of the convective plume from a point source in regimes ranging from weakly to highly turbulent. New features of the flow, as compared to \${\textbackslash}alpha{\textbackslash},\{=\}{\textbackslash},0\$, are documented and explained.The incoming heavier dyed fluid jet disintegrates into fast-sinking coherent blobs (in a low-Reynolds-number regime) or turbulent billows (in a high-Reynolds-number regime) and a more diffuse cloud of highly diluted dyed water. An analysis of the forces acting on an ellipsoid moving in a rotating fluid with the main balance including the buoyancy, Coriolis forces, and the hydrodynamic reaction due to generation of inertial waves correctly predicts the trajectory of a descending blob. It also explains the tendency of the plume to develop in the direction intermediate between \$\{{\textbackslash}bm g\}\_e\$ and \$\{{\textbackslash}bm {\textbackslash}Omega\}\$ and to shift `eastward' (lagging the rotation of the centrifuge) if the plume is envisaged as an ensemble of blobs.The stretching of the highly diluted dyed water along the absolute vorticity tubes with simultaneous shearing by horizontal quasi-two-dimensional flow produces conspicuous tilted structures or tilted Taylor `ink walls'. The misalignment between \$\{{\textbackslash}bm g\}\_e\$ and \$\{{\textbackslash}bm {\textbackslash}Omega\}\$ enhances the turbulent mixing and development of tilted structures by breaking the symmetry and producing motions directed away from the rotation axis.We argue that the conditions at the sites of ocean deep convection are favourable for the development of tilted structures because of the smallness of the Rossby number and an extreme homogenization of the mixed layer. We hypothesize that the homogenized sublayers observed within actively convecting regions in the ocean may not be horizontal, but in fact analogous to the tilted `ink walls' observed in the laboratory experiments and that they represent the internal structure of a plume on horizontal scales smaller than its depth.},

  abstract = {Abstract Commonly used parameterization of mixed layer instabilities in general circulation models (Fox-Kemper and Ferrari 2008a) was developed for temperate oceans and does not take into account the presence of sea ice in any way. However, the ice-ocean drag provides a strong mechanical coupling between the sea ice and the surface ocean currents and hence may affect mixed layer restratification processes. Here we use idealized simulations of mixed layer instabilities to demonstrate that the sea ice dramatically suppresses the eddy-driven overturning in the mixed layer by dissipating the eddy kinetic energy generated during instabilities. Considering the commonly-used viscous-plastic sea ice rheology, we developed an improvement to the existing mixed layer overturning parameterization, making it explicitly dependent on sea ice concentration. Below the critical sea ice concentration of about 0.68, the internal sea ice stresses are very weak and the conventional parameterization holds. At higher concentrations, the sea ice cover starts acting as a nearly-immobile surface lid, inducing strong dissipation of submesoscale eddies and reducing the intensity of the restratification streamfunction up to a factor of 4 for a fully ice-covered ocean. Our findings suggest that climate projection models might be exaggerating the restratification processes under sea ice, which could contribute to biases in mixed layer depth, salinity, ice-ocean heat fluxes, and sea ice cover.},

  abstract = {Abstract A better conceptual understanding and more realistic parameterizations of convective boundary layers in climate and weather prediction models have been major challenges in meteorological research. In particular, parameterizations of the dry convective boundary layer, in spite of the absence of water phase-changes and its consequent simplicity as compared to moist convection, typically suffer from problems in attempting to represent realistically the boundary layer growth and what is often referred to as countergradient fluxes. The eddy-diffusivity (ED) approach has been relatively successful in representing some characteristics of neutral boundary layers and surface layers in general. The mass-flux (MF) approach, on the other hand, has been used for the parameterization of shallow and deep moist convection. In this paper, a new approach that relies on a combination of the ED and MF parameterizations (EDMF) is proposed for the dry convective boundary layer. It is shown that the EDMF approach follows naturally from a decomposition of the turbulent fluxes into 1) a part that includes strong organized updrafts, and 2) a remaining turbulent field. At the basis of the EDMF approach is the concept that nonlocal subgrid transport due to the strong updrafts is taken into account by the MF approach, while the remaining transport is taken into account by an ED closure. Large-eddy simulation (LES) results of the dry convective boundary layer are used to support the theoretical framework of this new approach and to determine the parameters of the EDMF model. The performance of the new formulation is evaluated against LES results, and it is shown that the EDMF closure is able to reproduce the main properties of dry convective boundary layers in a realistic manner. Furthermore, it will be shown that this approach has strong advantages over the more traditional countergradient approach, especially in the entrainment layer. As a result, this EDMF approach opens the way to parameterize the clear and cumulus-topped boundary layer in a simple and unified way.},

By choosing a realistic large-scale forcing the authors have been able to simulate shallow convective clouds under quasi-steady-state conditions over a long period of 7 hours. This is a necessary condition to investigate diagnostic cumulus parameterization schemes since such schemes usually assume steady-state conditions. The response of the model to the applied large-scale forcing compares well with budget study results of BOMEX. In addition, the LES model delivers detailed information concerning the dynamics of shallow convective clouds. This is used to verify basic parameterizations of turbulent fluxes and entrainment and detrainment rates used in large-scale models. The most important conclusions are (i) the fractional entrainment and detrainment rates used in present large-scale atmospheric models are one order of magnitude too small, confirming previous results obtained by Esbensen, and (ii) estimates of turbulent fluxes by bulk cloud updrafts and environmental downdrafts give an underestimation of 20\% to 50\% depending on the variable that is transported.

The latter is subject to effects of modeled microphysical effects. Precipitation growth is parameterized in terms of an autoconversion equation and a collection equation. A precipitation fallout scheme is devised that depends on water content, drop spectrum, and the vertical rise rate of the tower. Then ``freezing subroutines'' are devised to model the effects of silver-iodide seeding. A hierarchy of seeding routines, using different ice collection efficiencies and terminal velocities, is partially tested against the data of the Stormfury 1965 tropical cumulus-seeding experiment. Some preliminary numerical experiments on warm clouds are performed, assuming changes in drop spectra from hygroscopic seeding.},

  abstract = {Abstract The observed development of deep mixed layers and the dependence of intense, deep-mixing events on wind and wave conditions are studied using an ocean LES model with and without an imposed Stokes-drift wave forcing. Model results are compared to glider measurements of the ocean vertical temperature, salinity and turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) dissipation rate structure collected in the Icelandic Basin. Observed wind stress reached 0.8 N m-2 with significant wave height of 4-6 m, while boundary layer depths reached 180 m. We find that wave forcing, via the commonly used Stokes drift vortex force parameterization, is crucial for accurate prediction of boundary layer depth as characterized by measured and predicted TKE dissipation rate profiles. Analysis of the boundary layer kinetic energy (KE) budget using a modified total Lagrangian-mean energy equation, derived for the wave averaged Boussinesq equations by requiring that the rotational inertial terms vanish identically as in the standard energy budget without Stokes forcing, suggests that wind work should be calculated using both the surface current and surface Stokes drift. A large percentage of total wind energy is transferred to model TKE via regular and Stokes drift shear production and dissipated. However, resonance by clockwise rotation of the winds can greatly enhance the generation of inertial current mean KE (MKE). Without resonance, TKE production is about 5 times greater than MKE generation, whereas with resonance this ratio decreases to roughly 2. The results have implications for the problem of estimating the global kinetic energy budget of the ocean.},

  abstract = {Numerical experiments were performed using a three-dimensional large-eddy simulation model of the ocean surface mixed layer that includes the Craik-Leibovich vortex force [Craik 1977; Leibovich 1977] to parameterize the interaction of surface waves with mean currents. Results from the experiments show that the vortex force generates Langmuir circulations that can dominate vertical mixing. The simulated vertical velocity fields show linear, small-scale, coherent structures near the surface that extend downwind across the model domain. In the interior of the mixed layer, scales of motion increase to eddy sizes that are roughly equivalent to the mixed-layer depth. Cases with the vortex force have stronger circulations near the surface in contrast to cases with only heat flux and wind stress, particularly when the heat flux is positive. Calculations of the velocity variance and turbulence dissipation rates for cases with and without the vortex force, surface cooling, and wind stress indicate that wave-current interactions are a dominant mixing process in the upper mixed layer. Heat flux calculations show that the entrainment rate at the mixed-layer base can be up to two times greater when the vortex force is included. In a case with reduced wind stress, turbulence dissipation rates remained high near the surface because of the vortex force interaction with preexisting inertial currents. In deep mixed layers ({$\sim$}250 m) the simulations show that Langmuir circulations can vertically transport water 145 m during conditions of surface heating. Observations of turbulence dissipation rates and the vertical temperature structure support the model results.},

  abstract = {The importance of leads, sea ice motion, and frazil ice on the wintertime ocean boundary layer was examined by using a large-eddy simulation turbulence model coupled to a thermodynamic slab ice model. Coupling was achieved through exchange coefficients that accounted for the differing diffusion rates of heat and salinity. Frazil ice concentrations were modeled by using an ice crystal parameterization with constant crystal size and shape. Stationary ice without leads produced cellular structures similar to atmospheric convection without winds. Ice motion caused this pattern to break down into a series of streaks aligned with the flow. Eddy fluxes were strongly affected by ice motion with relatively larger entrainment fluxes at the mixed layer base under moving ice, whereas stationary ice produced larger fluxes near the top of the boundary layer. Opening of leads caused significant changes in the turbulent structure of the boundary layer. Leads in stationary ice produced concentrated plumes of higher-salinity water beneath the lead. Ice motion caused the lead convection to follow preexisting convective rolls, enhancing the roll circulation salinity and vertical velocity under the lead. Comparison of model time series data with observations from the Arctic Leads Experiment showed general agreement for both pack ice and lead conditions. Simulated heat flux carried by frazil ice had a prominent role in the upper boundary layer, suggesting that frazil ice is important in the heat budget of ice-covered oceans.},

  abstract = {Recently, a new consistent way of parametrizing simultaneously local and non-local turbulent transport for the convective atmospheric boundary layer has been proposed and tested for the clear boundary layer. This approach assumes that in the convective boundary layer the subgrid-scale fluxes result from two different mixing scales: small eddies, that are parametrized by an eddy-diffusivity approach, and thermals, which are represented by a mass-flux contribution. Since the interaction between the cloud layer and the underlying sub-cloud layer predominantly takes place through strong updraughts, this approach offers an interesting avenue of establishing a unified description of the turbulent transport in the cumulus-topped boundary layer. This paper explores the possibility of such a new approach for the cumulus-topped boundary layer. In the sub-cloud and cloud layers, the mass-flux term represents the effect of strong updraughts. These are modelled by a simple entraining parcel, which determines the mean properties of the strong updraughts, the boundary-layer height, the lifting condensation level and cloud top. The residual smaller-scale turbulent transport is parametrized with an eddy-diffusivity approach that uses a turbulent kinetic energy closure. The new scheme is implemented and tested in the research model MesoNH. Copyright {\copyright} 2004 Royal Meteorological Society},

  abstract = {Abstract Open-ocean convection is a common phenomenon that regulates mixed layer depth and ocean ventilation in the high-latitude oceans. However, many climate model simulations overestimate mixed layer depth during open-ocean convection, resulting in excessive formation of dense water in some regions. The physical processes controlling transient mixed layer depth during open-ocean convection are examined using two different numerical models: a high-resolution, turbulence-resolving nonhydrostatic model and a large-scale hydrostatic ocean model. An isolated destabilizing buoyancy flux is imposed at the surface of both models and a quasi-equilibrium flow is allowed to develop. Mixed layer depth in the turbulence-resolving and large-scale models closely aligns with existing scaling theories. However, the large-scale model has an anomalously deep mixed layer prior to quasi-equilibrium. This transient mixed layer depth bias is a consequence of the lack of resolved turbulent convection in the model, which delays the onset of baroclinic instability. These findings suggest that in order to reduce mixed layer biases in ocean simulations, parameterizations of the connection between baroclinic instability and convection need to be addressed.},

The major point of the account so far is not to cover all subregions of the spectra or the ``universality'' arguments thoroughly, but to illustrate that we have come a long way in assessing past theories and are able to conclude that they perform reasonably well at the level of second-order statistics; such corrections as may arise from intermittency, to which we return in Anomalous Behaviors, are ignored here. The broad agreement with the theory has been tested primarily in cases where an isotropic and homogeneous velocity field is generated in a periodic cube, maintained stationary by forcing at a few of the lowest wavenumbers, and the scalar field is maintained stationary by a mean scalar gradient. Thus, it seems that, by virtue of the work that has taken some 70 y to complete, the physics for the second-order quantities are founded on solid enough ground to believe that they hold well as a working approximation (although with a few gaps). Concurrently, however, work of the last four decades has also shown that this approach, as well as the concepts behind it, breaks down for higher-order moments and that the notion of universality is fundamentally at peril. This is the topic in Anomalous Behaviors.},

  abstract = {Abstract Intermediate, or deep, convection in a baroclinic flow occurs along slanted paths parallel to the alongflow absolute momentum surfaces. These surfaces are principally tilted due to the vertical shear in velocity but can be further modified by a nonvertical axis of rotation. An inviscid Lagrangian parcel model, using realistic parameters, is utilized to illustrate, qualitatively, the different scenarios resulting from the combined action of inertial and gravitational forces acting on sinking parcels of dense fluid. More quantitative results are derived from a series of numerical experiments using a zonally invariant, high-resolution, nonhydrostatic model. Convection occuring in a flow with tilted absolute momentum surfaces will mix properties along these slanted surfaces. This implies that the fluid can retain a weak vertical stratification while overturning and also, more importantly, that the evolution of the convective layer cannot be described in terms of one-dimensional, vertical mixing. The authors show, for conditions typical of the Labrador Sea, that the convective layer depth difference between that estimated by mixing vertically and one obtained allowing for slantwise mixing can be greater than 100 m; slantwise convection reaches deeper because of the reduced stratification along the slanted paths. An alternative slantwise mixing scheme, based on the assumption of zero potential vorticity of the convected fluid, is proposed.},

  abstract = {Abstract The authors use large-eddy simulation (LES) to investigate entrainment and structure of the inversion layer of a clear convectively driven planetary boundary layer (PBL) over a range of bulk Richardson numbers, Ri. The LES code uses a nested grid technique to achieve fine resolution in all three directions in the inversion layer. Extensive flow visualization is used to examine the structure of the inversion layer and to illustrate the temporal and spatial interaction of a thermal plume and the overlying inversion. It is found that coherent structures in the convective PBL, that is, thermal plumes, are primary instigators of entrainment in the Ri range 13.6 {$\leq$} Ri {$\leq$} 43.8. At Ri = 13.6, strong horizontal and downward velocities are generated near the inversion layer because of the plume--interface interaction. This leads to folding of the interface and hence entrainment of warm inversion air at the plume's edge. At Ri = 34.5, the inversion's strong stability prevents folding of the interface but strong horizontal and downward motions near the plume's edge pull down pockets of warm air below the nominal inversion height. These pockets of warm air are then scoured off by turbulent motions and entrained into the PBL. The structure of the inversion interface from LES is in good visual agreement with lidar measurements in the PBL obtained during the Lidars in Flat Terrain field experiment. A quadrant analysis of the buoyancy flux shows that net entrainment flux (or average minimum buoyancy flux w{\texttheta}min) is identified with quadrant IV w-{\texttheta}+ {$<$} 0 motions, that is, warm air moving downward. Plumes generate both large negative quadrant II w+{\texttheta}- {$<$} 0 and positive quadrant III w-{\texttheta}- {$>$} 0 buoyancy fluxes that tend to cancel. The maximum vertical gradient in potential temperature at every (x, y) grid point is used to define a local PBL height, zi(x, y). A statistical analysis of zi shows that skewness of zi depends on the inversion strength. Spectra of zi exhibit a sensitivity to grid resolution. The normalized entrainment rate we/w{$\ast$}, where we and w{$\ast$} are entrainment and convective velocities, varies as ARi-1 with A {$\approx$} 0.2 in the range 13.6 {$\leq$} Ri {$\leq$} 43.8 and is in good agreement with convection tank measurements. For a clear convective PBL, the authors found that the finite thickness of the inversion layer needs to be considered in an entrainment rate parameterization derived from a jump condition.},

The new parameterization is based on the stochastic multiplume eddy-diffusivity/mass-flux (EDMF) approach, which distinguishes between convective plumes and nonconvective mixing. The convective plumes represent both surface-forced updrafts and evaporatively driven downdrafts. The type of convection (i.e., dry, shallow, or deep) represented by the updrafts is not defined a priori, but rather depends on the near-surface updraft properties and the stochastic interactions between the plumes and the environment through lateral entrainment. Consequently, some updrafts may contribute only to the nonlocal transport within the subcloud layer, while others may condense and form shallow or even deep convection. Such a formulation is void of trigger functions and additional closures typical of modular parameterizations. The updrafts are coupled to relatively simple warm-, mixed-, and ice-phase microphysics. Each precipitating updraft forms a downdraft driven by the evaporation of detrained precipitation. The downdrafts control the development of cold pools near the surface that can invigorate convection. The new parameterization is tested in a single-column model against large-eddy simulations (LESs) for cases representing weakly precipitating marine convection and the diurnal cycle of continental deep convection. The results of these EDMF experiments compare well with the LES reference simulations. In particular, the transitions between the different dominant convection regimes are realistically simulated.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {This paper seeks to illustrate the point that physical inconsistencies between thermodynamics and dynamics usually introduce nonconservative production/destruction terms in the local total energy balance equation in numerical ocean general circulation models (OGCMs). Such terms potentially give rise to undesirable forces and/or diabatic terms in the momentum and thermodynamic equations, respectively, which could explain some of the observed errors in simulated ocean currents and water masses. In this paper, a theoretical framework is developed to provide a practical method to determine such nonconservative terms, which is illustrated in the context of a relatively simple form of the hydrostatic Boussinesq primitive equation used in early versions of OGCMs, for which at least four main potential sources of energy nonconservation are identified; they arise from: (1) the ``hanging'' kinetic energy dissipation term; (2) assuming potential or conservative temperature to be a conservative quantity; (3) the interaction of the Boussinesq approximation with the parameterizations of turbulent mixing of temperature and salinity; (4) some adiabatic compressibility effects due to the Boussinesq approximation. In practice, OGCMs also possess spurious numerical energy sources and sinks, but they are not explicitly addressed here. Apart from (1), the identified nonconservative energy sources/sinks are not sign definite, allowing for possible widespread cancellation when integrated globally. Locally, however, these terms may be of the same order of magnitude as actual energy conversion terms thought to occur in the oceans. Although the actual impact of these nonconservative energy terms on the overall accuracy and physical realism of the oceans is difficult to ascertain, an important issue is whether they could impact on transient simulations, and on the transition toward different circulation regimes associated with a significant reorganization of the different energy reservoirs. Some possible solutions for improvement are examined. It is thus found that the term (2) can be substantially reduced by at least one order of magnitude by using conservative temperature instead of potential temperature. Using the anelastic approximation, however, which was initially thought as a possible way to greatly improve the accuracy of the energy budget, would only marginally reduce the term (4) with no impact on the terms (1), (2) and (3).},

In this paper, we develop a systematic methodology, called static energy asymptotics, that exploits this property for constructing energetically and thermodynamically consistent sound-proof approximations of the equations of motion. By approximating the static energy to various orders of accuracy, two main families of approximations are (re-)derived and discussed: the pseudo-incompressible (PI) approximation and a the anelastic (AN) approximation. In all cases, the background and available parts of the potential energy (in Lorenz sense) can be constructed to coincide exactly and approximately with their exact counterparts respectively, and in both cases be expressed in terms of the exact (as opposed to ad-hoc) thermodynamic potentials recently made available by TEOS-10. For hydrostatic motions, the AN approximation (of which the Boussinesq approximation is a special case) has the same structure as that of legacy seawater Boussinesq primitive equations numerical ocean models. The energetics of such models could therefore be made transparently traceable to that of the full Navier-Stokes equations at little to no additional cost, thus allowing them to take full advantage of the TEOS-10 Gibbs Sea Water (GSW) library.},

  abstract = {The static energy encodes all possible information about the thermodynamics and potential energy (and all related forces) of stratified geophysical fluids. In this paper, we develop a systematic methodology, called static energy asymptotics, that exploits this property for constructing energetically and thermodynamically consistent sound-proof approximations of the equations of motion. By approximating the static energy to various orders of accuracy, two main families of approximations are (re-)derived and discussed: the pseudo-incompressible (PI) approximation and the anelastic (AN) approximation. For all approximations, the background and available potential energies (in Lorenz sense) can be constructed to match their exact counterparts as closely as feasible and to be expressible in terms of the exact (as opposed to ad-hoc) thermodynamic potentials. For hydrostatic motions, the AN approximation (of which the Boussinesq approximation is a special case) has the same structure as that of legacy Seawater Boussinesq primitive equations. The energetics of such models could therefore be made transparently traceable to that of the full Navier--Stokes equations at little to no additional cost, thus allowing them to take full advantage of the Gibbs Sea Water (GSW) library developed as part of the new thermodynamic standard for seawater TEOS-10.},

  abstract = {In traditional and geophysical fluid dynamics, it is common to describe stratified turbulent fluid flows with low Mach number and small relative density variations by means of the incompressible Boussinesq approximation. Although such an approximation is often interpreted as decoupling the thermodynamics from the dynamics, this paper reviews recent results and derive new ones that show that the reality is actually more subtle and complex when diabatic effects and a nonlinear equation of state are retained. Such an analysis reveals indeed: (1) that the compressible work of expansion/contraction remains of comparable importance as the mechanical energy conversions in contrast to what is usually assumed; (2) in a Boussinesq fluid, compressible effects occur in the guise of changes in gravitational potential energy due to density changes. This makes it possible to construct a fully consistent description of the thermodynamics of incompressible fluids for an arbitrary nonlinear equation of state; (3) rigorous methods based on using the available potential energy and potential enthalpy budgets can be used to quantify the work of expansion/contraction {$B$} in steady and transient flows, which reveals that {$B$} is predominantly controlled by molecular diffusive effects, and act as a significant sink of kinetic energy.},

Additionally, the common practice of representing boundary-layer turbulence, shallow convection, and deep convection by discontinuously different parameterizations schemes, each with its own set of parameters, has contributed to the proliferation of adjustable parameters in largescale models. Here we lay the theoretical foundations for an extended eddy-diffusivity mass-flux (EDMF) scheme that has explicit time-dependence and memory of subgrid-scale variables and is designed to represent all subgrid-scale turbulence and convection, from boundary layer dynamics to deep convection, in a unified manner. Coherent up and downdrafts in the scheme are represented as prognostic plumes that interact with their environment and potentially with each other through entrainment and detrainment. The more isotropic turbulence in their environment is represented through diffusive fluxes, with diffusivities obtained from a turbulence kinetic energy budget that consistently partitions turbulence kinetic energy between plumes and environment. The cross-sectional area of up and downdrafts satisfies a prognostic continuity equation, which allows the plumes to cover variable and arbitrarily large fractions of a large-scale grid box and to have life cycles governed by their own internal dynamics. Relatively simple preliminary proposals for closure parameters are presented and are shown to lead to a successful simulation of shallow convection, including a time-dependent life cycle.},

The derivation is based on conditional filtering, which uses a set of quasi-Lagrangian labels to pick out different regions of the fluid, such as convective updrafts and environment, before applying a spatial filter. This results in a set of coupled prognostic equations for the different fluid components, including subfilter-scale flux terms and entrainment/detrainment terms. The framework can accommodate different types of approaches to parameterization, such as local turbulence approaches and mass flux approaches. It provides a natural way to distinguish between local and nonlocal transport processes and makes a clearer conceptual link to schemes based on coherent structures such as convective plumes or thermals than the straightforward application of a filter without the quasi-Lagrangian labels. The framework should facilitate the unification of different approaches to parameterization by highlighting the different approximations made and by helping to ensure that budgets of energy, entropy, and momentum are handled consistently and without double counting. The framework also points to various ways in which traditional parameterizations might be extended, for example, by including additional prognostic variables. One possibility is to allow the large-scale dynamics of all the fluid components to be handled by the dynamical core. This has the potential to improve several aspects of convection--dynamics coupling, such as dynamical memory, the location of compensating subsidence, and the propagation of convection to neighboring grid columns.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Conditional filtering decomposes the fluid into a number of categories or components, such as convective updraughts and the background environment, and derives governing equations for the dynamics of each component. Because of the novelty and unfamiliarity of these equations, it is important to establish some of their physical and mathematical properties and to examine whether their solutions might behave in counterintuitive or even unphysical ways. It is also important to understand the properties of the equations in order to develop suitable numerical solution methods. The conditionally filtered equations are shown to have conservation laws for mass, entropy, momentum or axial angular momentum, energy, and potential vorticity. The normal modes of the conditionally filtered equations include the usual acoustic, inertio-gravity, and Rossby modes of the standard compressible Euler equations. In addition, the equations support modes with different perturbations in the different fluid components that resemble gravity modes and inertial modes but with zero pressure perturbation. These modes make no contribution to the total filter-scale fluid motion, and their amplitude diminishes as the filter scale diminishes. Finally, it is shown that the conditionally filtered equations have a natural variational formulation, which can be used as a basis for systematically deriving consistent approximations.},

The Einstein vacuum equations for \$g\_{\textbackslash}lambda\$ are recast as a hierarchy of transport and wave equations, and their coupling induces a loss of derivatives. In order to solve it, we take advantage of a null foliation associated to \$g\_0\$ as well as a Fourier cut-off adapted to our ansatz.

On dimensional grounds the outflow velocity is taken to be constant and proportional to some characteristic turbulent velocity in the environment, while the entrainment velocity is proportional to the upward velocity of the element. Numerical solutions of the resulting non-dimensional equations of motion are presented, corresponding to a wide range of stabilities. Typically, an element in stable, neutral or moderately unstable surroundings at first grows and then is eroded away, but at a certain value of a stability parameter {$\gamma$} elements become absolutely unstable and continue to grow and rise indefinitely. The value of {$\gamma$} is extremely sensitive to the level of turbulence in the environment, which could therefore exert a controlling influence on the growth of buoyant elements in unstable conditions; large elements are more likely to grow when the level of turbulence is low.Laboratory experiments have been carried out in order to test one of the predictions of this theory, the form of the dependence of the height attained on total buoyancy and level of turbulence in uniform surroundings. The agreement is good, and numerical comparison of theory and experiment suggests that the assumed outflow velocity is of the same order as, but somewhat less than, the r.m.s. turbulent velocity.},

GFD, as usually understood, is a branch of the geosciences that deals with fluid dynamics and that, by tradition, seeks to extract the bare essence of a phenomenon, omitting detail where possible. The geosciences in general deal with complex interacting systems and in some ways resemble condensed matter physics or aspects of biology, where we seek explanations of phenomena at a higher level than simply directly calculating the interactions of all the constituent parts. That is, we try to develop theories or make simple models of the behaviour of the system as a whole. However, these days in many geophysical systems of interest, we can also obtain information for how the system behaves by almost direct numerical simulation from the governing equations. The numerical model itself then explicitly predicts the emergent phenomena---the Gulf Stream, for example---something that is still usually impossible in biology or condensed matter physics. Such simulations, as manifested, for example, in complicated general circulation models, have in some ways been extremely successful and one may reasonably now ask whether understanding a complex geophysical system is necessary for predicting it. In what follows we discuss such issues and the roles that GFD has played in the past and will play in the future.},

For this purpose, one-dimensional KPP simulations are compared across a suite of oceanographically relevant regimes against horizontally averaged large eddy simulations (LESs). We find the standard configuration of KPP consistent with LES across many forcing regimes, supporting its physical basis. Our evaluation also motivates recommendations for KPP best practices within ocean circulation models and identifies areas where further research is warranted. The original treatment of KPP recommends the matching of interior diffusivities and their gradients to the KPP-predicted values computed in the ocean surface boundary layer (OSBL). However, we find that difficulties in representing derivatives of rapidly changing diffusivities near the base of the OSBL can lead to loss of simulation fidelity. To mitigate this difficulty, we propose and evaluate two computationally simpler approaches: (1) match to the internal predicted diffusivity alone and (2) set the KPP diffusivity to 0 at the OSBL base. We find the KPP entrainment buoyancy flux to be sensitive to vertical grid resolution and details of how to diagnose the KPP boundary layer depth. We modify the KPP turbulent shear velocity parameterization to reduce resolution dependence. Additionally, an examination of LES vertical turbulent scalar flux budgets shows that the KPP-parameterized nonlocal tracer flux is incomplete due to the assumption that it solely redistributes the surface tracer flux.

This is interesting and nontrivial because in Eulerian representation, the time t maps need not be C1 from the Sobolev class Hs to itself (where s {$>$} (n/2) + 1). The idea of how this difficulty is overcome is to exploit the fact that one does have smoothness in the Lagrangian representation and then carefully perform a LiePoisson reduction procedure.},

  abstract = {When a rotating layer of fluid is heated uniformly from below and cooled from above, the onset of instability is inhibited by the rotation. The first part of this paper treats the stability problem as it was considered by Chandrasekhar (1953), but with particular emphasis on the physical interpretation of the results. It is shown that the time-dependent (overstable) motions occur because they can reduce the stabilizing effect of rotation. It is also shown that the boundary of a steady convection cell is distorted by the rotation in such a way that the wave length of the cell measured along the distorted boundary is equal to the wavelength of the non-rotating cell. This conservation of cellular wavelength is traced to the constancy of horizontal vorticity in the rotating and non-rotating systems. In the finite-amplitude investigation the analysis, which is pivoted about the linear stability problem, indicates that the fluid can become unstable to finite-amplitude disturbances before it becomes unstable to infinitesimal perturbations. The finite-amplitude motions generate a non-linear vorticity which tends to counteract the vorticity generated by the imposed constraint of rotation. Under experimental conditions the two fluids, mercury and air, which are considered in this paper, will not exhibit this finite amplitude instability. However, a fluid with a sufficiently small Prandtl number will become unstable to finite-amplitude perturbations. The special role of viscosity as an energy releasing mechanism in this problem and in the Orr-Sommerfeld problem suggests that the occurrence of a finite-amplitude instability depends on this dual role of viscosity (i.e. as an energy releasing mechanism as well as the more familiar dissipative mechanism). The relative stability criterion developed by Malkus \& Veronis (1958) is used to determine the preferred type of cellular motions which can occur in the fluid. This preferred motion is a function of the Prandtl number and the Taylor number. In the case of air it is shown that overstable square cells become preferred in finite amplitude, even though steady convective motions occur at a lower Rayleigh number.},

Among these, jets are determinant in the air and water circulation around the Earth. In the last fifty years, thanks to the development of more and more precise and extensive observations, it has been possible to study in detail the atmospheric formations of the giant-gas planets in the solar system. For those planets, jets are the dominant large scale structure. Starting from the 70s, various theories combining observations and mathematical models have been proposed in order to describe their formation and stability. In this paper, we propose a purely algebraic approach to describe the spontaneous formation of jets on a spherical domain. Analysing the algebraic properties of the 2D Euler equations, we give a characterization of the different jets' structures. The calculations are performed starting from the discrete Zeitlin model of the Euler equations. For this model, the classification of the jets' structures can be precisely described in terms of reductive Lie algebras decomposition. The discrete framework provides a simple tool for analysing both from a theoretical and and a numerical perspective the jets' formation. Furthermore, it allows to extend the results to the original Euler equations.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Ocean convection is a key mechanism that regulates heat uptake, water-mass transformation, CO2 exchange, and nutrient transport with crucial implications for ocean dynamics and climate change. Both cooling to the atmosphere and salinification, from evaporation or sea-ice formation, cause surface waters to become dense and down-well as turbulent convective plumes. The upper mixed layer in the ocean is significantly deepened and sustained by convection. In the tropics and subtropics, night-time cooling is a main driver of mixed layer convection, while in the mid- and high-latitude regions, winter cooling is key to mixed layer convection. Additionally, at higher latitudes, and particularly in the sub-polar North Atlantic Ocean, the extensive surface heat loss during winter drives open-ocean convection that can reach thousands of meters in depth. On the Antarctic continental shelf, polynya convection regulates the formation of dense bottom slope currents. These strong convection events help to drive the immense water-mass transport of the globally-spanning meridional overturning circulation (MOC). However, convection is often highly localised in time and space, making it extremely difficult to accurately measure in field observations. Ocean models such as global circulation models (GCMs) are unable to resolve convection and turbulence and, instead, rely on simple convective parameterizations that result in a poor representation of convective processes and their impact on ocean circulation, air--sea exchange, and ocean biology. In the past few decades there has been markedly more observations, advancements in high-resolution numerical simulations, continued innovation in laboratory experiments and improvement of theory for ocean convection. The impacts of anthropogenic climate change on ocean convection are beginning to be observed, but key questions remain regarding future climate scenarios. Here, we review the current knowledge and future direction of ocean convection arising from sea--surface interactions, with a focus on mixed layer, open-ocean, and polynya convection.},

CATKE is a one-equation model that predicts diffusive turbulent vertical fluxes a prognostic turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and a diagnostic mixing length that features a dynamic model for convective adjustment (CA). With its convective mixing length, CATKE predicts not just the depth range where microturbulence acts but also the timescale over which mixing occurs, an important aspect of turbulent convection not captured by convective adjustment schemes. As a result, CATKE can describe the competition between convection and other processes such as baroclinic restractification or biogeochemical production-destruction. We estimate CATKE's free parameters with a posteriori calibration to eighteen large eddy simulations of the ocean surface boundary layer, and validate CATKE against twelve additional large eddy simulations with stronger and weaker forcing than used during calibration. We find that a CATKE-parameterized single column model accurately predicts the depth structure of buoyancy and momentum at vertical resolutions between 2 and 16 meters and with time steps of 10-20 minutes. We propose directions for future model development, and future efforts to recalibrate CATKE's parameters against more comprehensive and realistic datasets.},

At the end of integration (typically 20--40 inertial periods), the so-called natural Rossby number for the rotating experiments varies from 0.06 to 2. The wide range of conditions used is designed to extract scaling laws of rotating convection and to shed light on the importance of Earth's rotation on convection. It is found that the effects of rotation can be characterized by a series of hyperbolic tangent functions of the natural Rossby number. The effects of rotation are most pronounced when Ro is order 0.1 or less. For Ro{$\geq$}1, the effects of rotation become small. Comparison of Lagrangian statistics of numerical floats reveals that horizontal mixing is suppressed in the presence of rotation. This result is consistent with the finding that integral length scale and turbulent intensity decrease when rotation is included, in contrast to the conclusion of an early study that argued for increased horizontal mixing in the presence of rotation.},

  abstract = {Abstract The deep diurnal cycle of turbulence at the equator is studied using the technique of large-eddy simulation (LES). Based on a scale-separation hypothesis, the LES model includes the following large-scale flow terms: the equatorial undercurrent (EUC), zonal pressure gradient, upwelling, horizontal divergence, zonal temperature gradient, and mesoscale eddy forcing terms for the zonal momentum and the heat equations. The importance of these terms in obtaining a quasi-equilibrium boundary layer solution is discussed. The model is forced with a constant easterly wind stress and diurnal cooling and heating. It is found that boundary-layer turbulence penetrates as deep as 50 m below the mixed layer during nighttime cooling. The diurnal variation of turbulence dissipation and mixed layer depth are within the range of observations. The gradient Richardson number (Ri) of the mean flow shows a diurnal cycle but the amplitudes decrease with depth. Within the mixed layer and just below the layer, Ri can be lower than the critical value of 0.25 at night. During the day, Ri {$>$} 0.25 below the mixed layer. Well below the mixed layer (below about 40 m), Ri is always greater than 0.25 because of the initial vertical profiles of EUC and temperature chosen. However, the flow is still highly nonlinear, or turbulent, as indicated by the order one ratio of fluctuating temperature gradient (root-mean-square) to the mean gradient. The authors find that this deep turbulence cycle from the model is closely related to local shear (or Kelvin--Helmholtz) instability. Distribution of local (pointwise) gradient Richardson number shows a diurnal cycle, which is the cause of the diurnal cycle of turbulence well below the mixed layer as evidenced by high levels of turbulent kinetic energy at local Richardson numbers in the range of [0, 0.25]. Eddy viscosity and diffusivity are computed from the LES solutions and are compared with observationally derived values.},

  abstract = {Abstract Large eddy simulation is used to study top-hat parameterizations of second- and third-order scalar statistics in cumulus and stratocumulus cloud-topped boundary layers (CTBLs). Although the top-hat parameterizations based on commonly used conditional sampling methods are a useful approach to modeling the vertical fluxes in the simulated CTBLs, they fail to realistically represent the scalar variances. The reason is that the common sampling methods are based at least in part on the sign of vertical velocity, but not on the sign of the scalars whose variances are represented and that scalars and velocity are not perfectly correlated. Furthermore, the self-correlation nature for a variance means that all the fluctuations contribute to its value, while the top-hat models completely ignore the deviations from the top-hat means and thus considerably degrade the representation of the variance. For the fluxes, however, only the coherent convective elements make the most contribution. Analysis of analytic models and ``toy'' time series indicates in a more generic setting that the effect of poor correlations between the signal upon which the sampling is based and the signal whose variance is to be represented tends to degrade the ability of top-hat parameterizations to capture the variance. The analysis of toy time series also indicates that variability among individual events within a composite degrades the top-hat representation of the variance more than variability within events. For the vertical velocity--scalar-related third-order moments, the top-hat model gives reasonable estimates for the cumulus CTBL but not for the stratocumulus CTBL. These differences are explained by structural differences (tied to circulation differences in the two CTBLs) in their respective joint probability density functions of vertical velocity and various scalars.},

  abstract = {Traditional parameterizations of convection are a large source of error in weather and climate prediction models, and the assumptions behind them become worse as resolution increases. Multifluid modeling is a promising new method of representing subgrid-scale and near-grid-scale convection allowing for net mass transport by convection and nonequilibrium dynamics. The air is partitioned into two or more fluids, which may represent, for example, updrafts and the nonupdraft environment. Each fluid has its own velocity, temperature, and constituents with separate equations of motion. This paper presents two-fluid Boussinesq equations for representing subgrid-scale dry convection with sinking and w = 0 air in Fluid 0 and rising air in Fluid 1. Two vertical slice test cases are developed to tune parameters and to evaluate the two-fluid equations: a buoyant rising bubble and radiative convective equilibrium. These are first simulated at high resolution with a single-fluid model and conditionally averaged based on the sign of the vertical velocity. The test cases are next simulated with the two-fluid model in one column. A model for entrainment and detrainment based on divergence leads to excellent representation of the convective area fraction. Previous multifluid modeling of convection has used the same pressure for both fluids. This is shown to be a bad approximation, and a model for the pressure difference between the fluids based on divergence is presented.},

The external parameters are buoyancy forcing of strength, B0, applied over a circular area of radius Rs, the rotation rate as measured by f, ambient stratification N, and the depth H. The experiments are motivated by physical scaling arguments which attempt to predict the length and velocity scales of the convective chimney as it adjusts under gravity and rotation and breaks up through baroclinic instability. The scales of interest include the number, size, and typical speeds of the fragments of the broken chimney, the final depth of penetration of the convective mixed layer, and the total volume of convectively produced water. These scales are tested against the laboratory experiments and found to be appropriate. In this idealized problem we have found the depth of penetration depends only on the size and strength of the forcing and the ambient stratification encountered by the convection event; it does not depend explicitly on rotation. The implications of the work to deep water formation in the Labrador Sea and elsewhere are discussed. Finally, the study has relevance to the role and representation of baroclinic eddies in large-scale circulation of the ocean.},

  abstract = {Abstract In this study a new approach to the vertical transport of the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) is proposed. The principal idea behind the new parameterization is that organized updrafts or convective plumes play an important role in transferring TKE vertically within convectively driven boundary layers. The parameterization is derived by applying an updraft environment decomposition to the vertical velocity triple correlation term in the TKE prognostic equation. The additional mass flux (MF) term that results from this decomposition closely resembles the features of the TKE transport diagnosed from the large-eddy simulation (LES) and accounts for 97\% of the LES-diagnosed transport when the updraft fraction is set to 0.13. Another advantage of the MF term is that it is a function of the updraft vertical velocity and can be readily calculated using already existing parameterization. The new MF approach, combined with several eddy diffusivity (ED) formulations, is implemented into a simplified 1D TKE prognostic model. The 1D model results, compared against LES simulations of dry convective boundary layers, show substantial improvement in representing the vertical structure of TKE. The new combined ED--MF parameterization, as well as the MF term alone, surpasses in accuracy the ED parameterizations. The proposed TKE transport parameterization shows large potential of improving TKE simulations in mesoscale and global circulation models.},

  abstract = {Abstract This study presents a new approach to the eddy diffusivity/mass flux (EDMF) framework for the modeling of convective boundary layers. At the root of EDMF lies a decomposition of turbulent transport mechanisms into strong ascending updrafts and smaller-scale turbulent motions. The turbulent fluxes can be therefore described using two conventional approaches: mass flux (MF) for the organized thermals and eddy diffusivity (ED) for the remaining turbulent field. Since the intensities of both MF and ED transports depend on the kinetic energy of the turbulent motions, it seems reasonable to formulate an EDMF framework based on turbulent kinetic energy (TKE). Such an approach allows for more physical and less arbitrary formulations of parameters in the model. In this study the EDMF--TKE coupling is achieved through the use of (i) a new parameterization for the lateral entrainment coefficient {$\varepsilon$} and (ii) the MF contribution to the buoyancy source of TKE. Some other important features of the EDMF parameterization presented here include a revised mixing length formulation and Monin--Obukhov stability scaling for the surface layer. The scheme is implemented in a one-dimensional (1D) model. Several cases of dry convective boundary layers (CBL) with different surface sensible heat fluxes in the free-convection limit are investigated. Results are compared to large-eddy simulation (LES). Good agreement between LES and the 1D model is achieved with respect to mean profiles, boundary layer evolution, and updraft characteristics. Some disagreements between the models are found to most likely relate to deficiencies in the TKE simulation in the 1D model. Comparison with other previously established {$\varepsilon$} parameterizations shows that the new TKE-based formulation leads to equally accurate, and in many respects better, simulation of the CBL. The encouraging results obtained with the proposed EDMF framework indicate that full integration of EDMF with higher-order closures is possible and can further improve boundary layer simulations.},

  abstract = {Abstract Dynamical effects of organized cumulus convection on its environment with vertical wind shear are studied. Analyses of the wind field and momentum budget residual for mesoscale convective systems observed during SESAME and PRE-STORM reveal systematic differences in the vertical transport of horizontal momentum between mesoscale convective complex (MCC) and squall line cases. In the MCC, a distinct minimum in wind speed appears over the area of intense convection and the momentum budget residual acts to decelerate the environmental wind and to reduce the upper-level vertical shear. Therefore, the inferred vertical transport of momentum in the MCC is downgradient in the upper layer. On the other hand, in the squall line, there is no wind speed minimum and the upper-level vertical shear of the line-normall component of the environmental wind increases as convection develops. Thus, the vertical transport of momentum normal to the squall line is upgradient in the upper layer, although the transport of momentum parallel to the line is downgradient. The effects of cumulus convection on the environmental flow are through the subsidence of environmental air that compensates the cloud mass flux, the detrainment of momentum from clouds, and the convective-scale horizontal pressure gradient force acting on the environment. A cumulus momentum parameterization including the convective-scale pressure gradient force is formulated. The pressure gradient force is related to the vertical wind shear, cloud mass flux, and orientation of organized convection. The parameterization is capable of reproducing both the upgradient and downgradient transports of horizontal momentum, provided the mode of organization of cumulus convection is known.},

As atmospheric boundary-layer flows of different atmospheric stratification have very different flow characteristics on different length scales, well-resolved simulations of these flows require very different meshes. The Parallelized Large-Eddy Simulation Model combined with a realizable dynamic subgrid model is used to identify the best method for evaluating the resolution requirements for boundary-layer flows simulated by large-eddy simulations. In particular, we consider three atmospheric boundary-layer set-ups with different stratifications (stable, neutral, convective) to investigate how the quality of the simulation changes with the grid resolution. By following the work of Davidson (Int J Heat Fluid Flow 30(5):1016--1025, 2009), the results are examined using criteria such as the convergence of mean profiles, the ratio of modelled and resolved turbulence kinetic energy, and the two-point correlation. We conclude that the two-point correlation is the best measure to evaluate whether the resolution demands for a specific flow are fulfilled.},

Direct observations of the surface stress and heat flux over a horizontally uniform site enable presentation of the data in terms of surface layer similarity theory. The dissipation term, obtained from differentiated hot-wire anemometer signals, agrees with estimates made from the inertial subrange levels of longitudinal velocity spectra with a value of 0.5 for the spectral constant. Under stable conditions dissipation essentially balances shear production, while turbulent transport and buoyant production are of secondary importance. Under unstable conditions, dissipation slightly exceeds the total production, and energy is also lost at a substantial rate due to upward export by the turbulence. The large imbalance among the measured terms in the energy budget under unstable conditions is discussed. The cause of the imbalance cannot at this point be determined with certainty, but an interesting possibility is that pressure transport is significant under very unstable conditions. The production rate of temperature variance exceeds its rate of vertical transport by an order of magnitude. Estimates of the universal temperature spectral constant were made with the assumption that temperature variance dissipation and production rates are equal; the average value, 0.8, falls within the range reported by other workers.},

  abstract = {Wind forcing of the ocean generates a spectrum of inertia-gravity waves that is sharply peaked near the local inertial (or Coriolis) frequency. The corresponding near-inertial waves (NIWs) are highly energetic and play a significant role in the slow, large-scale dynamics of the ocean. To analyse this role, we develop a new model of the nondissipative interactions between NIWs and balanced motion. The model is derived using the generalised-Lagrangian-mean (GLM) framework (specifically, the glm variant of Soward \& Roberts (2010)), taking advantage of the time-scale separation between the two types of motion to average over the short NIW period. We combine Salmon's (2013) variational formulation of GLM with Whitham averaging to obtain a system of equations governing the joint evolution of NIWs and mean flow. Assuming that the mean flow is geostrophically balanced reduces this system to a simple model coupling Young \& Ben Jelloul's (1997) equation for NIWs with a modified quasi-geostrophic equation. In this coupled model, the mean flow affects the NIWs through advection and refraction; conversely, the NIWs affect the mean flow by modifying the potential-vorticity inversion - the relation between advected potential vorticity and advecting mean velocity - through a quadratic wave term, consistent with the GLM results of Bu hler \& McIntyre (1998). The coupled model is Hamiltonian and its conservation laws, for wave action and energy in particular, prove illuminating: on their basis, we identify a new interaction mechanism whereby NIWs forced at large scales extract energy from the balanced flow as their horizontal scale is reduced by differential advection and refraction so that their potential energy increases. A rough estimate suggests that this mechanism could provide a significant sink of energy for mesoscale motion and play a part in the global energetics of the ocean.},

It introduces a subgrid stress tensor that naturally emerges from a modified Reynolds transport theorem adapted to this stochastic representation of the flow. This principle is used within a stochastic shallow water model coupled with an 4DEnVar assimilation technique to estimate both the flow initial conditions and the inhomogeneous time-varying subgrid parameters. The performance of this modelling has been assessed numerically with both synthetic and real-world data. Our strategy has shown to be very effective in providing a more relevant prior/posterior ensemble in terms of the dispersion compared to other tests using the standard shallow water equations with no subgrid parameterization or with simple eddy viscosity models. We also compared two localization techniques. The results indicate the localized covariance approach is more suitable to deal with the scale discrepancy-related errors.},

It is based on three axioms and one assumption regarding the complexity in continuous systems. By relaxing one axiom and an assumption, we find that the complexity formula is naturally generalized to the Schatten p -norm type. We also clarify the relation between our complexity and other works. First, we show that our results in a bi-invariant geometry are consistent with the ones in a right-invariant geometry such as k -local geometry. Here, a careful analysis of the sectional curvature is crucial. Second, we show that our complexity can concretely realize the conjectured pattern of the time-evolution of the complexity: the linear growth up to saturation time. The saturation time can be estimated by the relation between the topology and curvature of SU( n ) groups.},

  abstract = {An asymptotic theory of marginal thermal convection in rotating systems is constructed for the limit of rapid rotation. Many self-gravitating astronomical bodies, including the major planets, the Sun, and the Earth's liquid core, correspond to this limit. In the laboratory, an analogous system can be constructed with a very rapidly rotating apparatus, in which the centrifugal force plays the role of self-gravitation. The formulation is offered in such a way that both these geophysical systems and laboratory analogues are included as special cases. When the inclination of the outer boundaries relative to the equatorial plane is considered weak, the two types of system are identical at leading order. In this limit, the asymptotic analysis is profoundly simplified, because the system satisfies the Taylor-Proudman theorem to leading order. Nevertheless the system contains a very peculiar property: the mode defined by a conventional WKBJ theory implicitly assuming a locality of convection in the radial direction perpendicular to the axis of rotation cannot be accepted as a correct marginal mode, because a modulation equation gives an exponential growth in the radial direction, which contradicts an implicit initial assumption. The erroneous behaviour is traced to a spatial dispersion of thermal Rossby waves, which governs the marginal mode. The difficulty is resolved by extending the analysis to a complex plane of the radial coordinate of the point where convection amplitude attains its maximum. Such a complex radial distance is defined as the point where the wave dispersion disappears locally. The projection of the solution onto the real axis results in an inclination of the Taylor columns with respect to the radial direction. This is in good agreement with the most recent numerical studies. The isolation of convective Taylor columns in the radial direction weakens and the spiralling gets stronger as the Prandtl number decreases, as a result of the need to displace the critical radial distance further from the real axis.},

Though this equation is long since presented by Arakawa and Schubert (1974), a formal derivation is not known in the literature. The derivation of this formulation is of increasing interests in recent years due to the fact that it can explain basic aspects of the convective dynamics such as discharge--recharge and transition from shallow to deep convection. The derivation is presented in two manners: (i) for the case that only the vertical component of the velocity is considered and (ii) the case that both the horizontal and vertical components are considered. The equation reduces to the same form as originally presented by Arakwa and Schubert in both cases, but with the energy dissipation term defined differently. In both cases, nevertheless, the energy ``dissipation'' (loss) term consists of the three principal contributions: (i) entrainment--detrainment, (ii) outflow from top of convection, and (iii) pressure effects. Additionally, inflow from the bottom of convection contributing to a growth of convection is also formally counted as a part of the dissipation term. The eddy dissipation is also included for a completeness. The order-of-magnitude analysis shows that the convective kinetic energy ``dissipation'' is dominated by the pressure effects, and it may be approximately described by Rayleigh damping with a constant time scale of the order of 102--103s. The conclusion is also supported by a supplementary analysis of a cloud-resolving model (CRM) simulation. The Appendix discusses how the loss term (``dissipation'') of the convective kinetic energy is qualitatively different from the conventional eddy-dissipation process found in turbulent flows.},

These parameterizations use horizontal means over the subdomains occupied by these physical components to define the mass fluxes and transported variables. However, evaluations of the mass flux formulation against high-resolution spatial data obtained from explicit numerical models reveal that it substantially underestimates vertical transport of heat, moisture, and momentum by deep convection. The present paper proposes an alternative approach, in which the effective values weighted toward extreme values are used both for the mass flux and the transported variable to obtain an accurate estimate of vertical transport. Statistically, the distribution of convective variables is so widely distributed within individual subdomains that the vertical transports are controlled by extreme values, rather than by simple means. Evaluation for these effective values are facilitated by considering four categories depending on the sign of both the vertical velocity and the transported variable, instead of the conventional convective-type classifications. A best estimate of the effective value is obtained empirically by weighting the variable by a power of one-quarter during the averaging. A major consequence of this alternative approach is that the mass fluxes must be defined differently for the individual variables. Thus, chemical species would not be transported by the same mass flux as that for temperature or moisture. With this extra elaboration, the proposed formulation provides more robust estimation of the subgrid- scale convective transports.},

  abstract = {Abstract An atmospheric convective system may be modeled as an ensemble of discrete plume elements. A representation of decomposited plumes provides the basis for mass-flux convective parameterization. A dry version of such a prototype model is constructed in a two-dimensional horizontally periodic domain. Each discrete plume element is approximated by a horizontally homogeneous segment such that the whole system is given by segmentally constant approximations (SCA) in the horizontal direction for each vertical level in a nonhydrostatic anelastic model (NAM). The distribution of constant segments is highly inhomogeneous in space and evolves with time in a highly adaptive manner. The basic modeling strategy from a physical point of view is to activate new segments vertically upward with time when a convective plume is growing and to deactivate segments when a plume event is over. The difference in physical values crossing segment interfaces is used as a criterion for numerically implementing this strategy. Whenever a large difference is found, the given interface is stretched vertically by subdividing an existing segment into two. In turn, when a segment interface difference is found below the threshold, the given interface is removed, thereby merging the two segments into one. This nonhydrostatic anelastic model with segmentally constant approximations (NAM--SCA) is tested on an idealized atmospheric convective boundary layer. It successfully simulates the evolution of convective plumes with a relatively limited number of segments (i.e., high compression) and with a much scarcer distribution of segments over nonplume environments (i.e., extremely inhomogeneous distribution of segments). Overall, this method compresses the size of the model up to 5 times compared to a standard NAM with homogeneous grid distribution without substantially sacrificing numerical accuracy.},

The seawater Boussinesq approximation simplifies the mass conservation equation to ∇ {$\cdot$} u = 0, employs the nonlinear equation of state of seawater to obtain the buoyancy force, and uses the conservative temperature introduced by McDougall as a thermal variable. The conserved energy consists of the kinetic energy plus the Boussinesq dynamic enthalpy h{\ddag}, which is the integral of the buoyancy with respect to geopotential height Z at a fixed conservative temperature and salinity. In the Boussinesq approximation, the full specific enthalpy h is the sum of four terms: McDougall's potential enthalpy, minus the geopotential g0Z, plus the Boussinesq dynamic enthalpy h{\ddag}, and plus the dynamic pressure. The seawater Boussinesq approximation removes the large and dynamically inert contributions to h, and it reveals the important conversions between kinetic energy and h{\ddag}.},

  abstract = {New analytic estimates of the rate at which parametric subharmonic instability (PSI) transfers energy to high-vertical-wavenumber near-inertial oscillations are presented. These results are obtained by a heuristic argument which provides insight into the physical mechanism of PSI, and also by a systematic application of the method of multiple time scales to the Boussinesq equations linearized about a `pump wave' whose frequency is close to twice the inertial frequency. The multiple-scale approach yields an amplitude equation describing how the 2               f               0               -pump energizes a vertical continuum of near-inertial oscillations. The amplitude equation is solved using two models for the 2               f               0               -pump: (i) an infinite plane internal wave in a medium with uniform buoyancy frequency; (ii) a vertical mode one internal tidal wavetrain in a realistically stratified and bounded ocean. In case (i) analytic expressions for the growth rate of PSI are obtained and validated by a successful comparison with numerical solutions of the full Boussinesq equations. In case (ii), numerical solutions of the amplitude equation indicate that the near-inertial disturbances generated by PSI are concentrated below the base of the mixed layer where the velocity of the pump wave train is largest. Based on these examples we conclude that the               e               -folding time of PSI in oceanic conditions is of the order of ten days or less.},

This `NIO equation' uses a complex field, M(x, y, z, t). related to the demodulated horizontal velocity by M, = exp (ifot)(u + iv), wherefa is the inertial frequency. The three processes of wave dispersion, advection by geostrophic velocity and refraction (geostrophic vorticity slightly shifts the local inertial frequency) are all included in the formulation. The NIO equation has an energy conservation law, so that there is no transfer of energy between NIOs and the geostrophic flow in the approximation scheme. As an application, the NIO equation is used to examine propagation of waves through a field of smaller scale, geostrophic eddies. The spatially local 512 frequency shift, identified by earlier WKB calculations (5 is the vertical vorticity of the geostrophic eddies), is not expressed directly in the wave field: the large-scale NIO samples regions of both positive and negative 5 so that there is cancellation. Instead, the 5/2 frequency shift is rectified to produce an average dispersive effect. The calculation predicts that an NIO with infinite horizontal scale has a frequency shift -Kfom2/N2 where K is average kinetic energy density of the geostrophic eddies, m the vertical wavenumber of the NIO,fe the inertial frequency and N the buoyancy frequency. Because of the dependence of the frequency shift on m2, there is an effective vertical dispersion, whose strength is proportional to the eddy kinetic energy. This process greatly increases the vertical propagation rate of synoptic scale NIOs.},

  abstract = {Transport-based density estimation methods are receiving growing interest because of their ability to efficiently generate samples from the approximated density. We further invertigate the sequential transport maps framework proposed from [10, 11], which builds on a sequence of composed Knothe-Rosenblatt (KR) maps. Each of those maps are built by first estimating an intermediate density of moderate complexity, and then by computing the exact KR map from a reference density to the precomputed approximate density. In our work, we explore the use of Sumof-Squares (SoS) densities and {$\alpha$}-divergences for approximating the intermediate densities. Combining SoS densities with {$\alpha$}-divergence interestingly yields convex optimization problems which can be efficiently solved using semidefinite programming. The main advantage of {$\alpha$}-divergences is to enable working with unnormalized densities, which provides benefits both numerically and theoretically. In particular, we provide two new convergence analyses of the sequential transport maps: one based on a triangle-like inequality and the second on information geometric properties of {$\alpha$}-divergences for unnormalizied densities. The choice of intermediate densities is also crucial for the efficiency of the method. While tempered (or annealed) densities are the state-of-the-art, we introduce diffusion-based intermediate densities which permits to approximate densities known from samples only. Such intermediate densities are well-established in machine learning for generative modeling. Finally we propose and try different low-dimensional maps (or lazy maps) for dealing with high-dimensional problems and numerically demonstrate our methods on several benchmarks, including Bayesian inference problems and unsupervised learning task.},

  abstract = {Abstract Monin--Obukhov similarity theory (MOST) provides important scaling laws for flow properties in the surface layer of the atmosphere and has contributed to most of our understanding of the near-surface turbulence. The prediction of near-surface vertical mixing in most operational ocean models is largely built upon this theory. However, the validity of MOST in the upper ocean is questionable due to the demonstrated importance of surface waves in the region. Here we examine the validity of MOST in the statically unstable oceanic surface layer, using data collected from two open ocean sites with different wave conditions. The observed vertical temperature gradients are found to be about half of those predicted by MOST. We hypothesize this is attributable to either the breaking of surface waves, or Langmuir turbulence generated by the wave--current interaction. Existing turbulence closure models for surface wave breaking and for Langmuir turbulence are simplified to test these two hypotheses. Although both models predict reduced temperature gradients, the simplified Langmuir turbulence model matches observations more closely, when appropriately tuned.},
